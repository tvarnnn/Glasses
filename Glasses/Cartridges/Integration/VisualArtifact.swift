/// How a piece of imagery has been treated before this app was allowed to show
/// it.
///
/// ## The pipeline this sits at the end of
///
/// ```text
/// raw sensor data → ephemeral perception → derived structured state
///                 → redaction → persistence / display
/// ```
///
/// `docs/06-PRIVACY-DATA.md` is explicit that the reduction step is not itself a
/// safety guarantee:
///
/// > Selected crops or "reduced" imagery are not inherently safe: a cropped
/// > image can still contain a bystander's face, a private room, or a document.
/// > Treat any stored image/crop as potentially sensitive, regardless of size or
/// > selection method.
///
/// So this type does **not** describe how small an image is or where it came
/// from. It describes one thing: whether a redaction step was actually applied
/// by whoever produced it. That is a fact only the producer knows, which is why
/// there is no `.probablySafe` and no default — an artifact whose treatment was
/// not stated is `.unknown`, and `.unknown` is displayed with the same reserve
/// as raw.
///
/// ## What this cannot do
///
/// **It does not redact anything.** iOS applies no redaction and must not
/// pretend to: doing so here would mean the raw pixels had already reached the
/// phone, at which point the control is theatre. `docs/06-PRIVACY-DATA.md`
/// requires redaction to happen where the data is derived, and this app's job
/// is to refuse to display what has not been treated and to say which is which.
///
/// It is therefore **not a user-facing privacy control**. There is no toggle
/// backed by this. A switch the Tower cannot honour is worse than no switch,
/// because it converts a limitation into a false assurance.

/// is the state machine around a fetch — is there one, is it in flight, did it
/// arrive, may it be shown — and that is what this models.
