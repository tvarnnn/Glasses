/// on every camera frame. It does not advance while the device is asleep,
/// which is the behaviour we want here: a suspended app is not capturing
/// frames, so that time must not count against a session's measured rate.
///
/// Explicitly `nonisolated`: the project builds with
/// `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor`, which would otherwise make a
/// pure clock read main-actor-only — unusable from a default argument, and
/// unusable from DAT's callback thread if the rate gate is ever moved ahead of

/// This replaces the fixed 1-in-30 frame stride that used to gate Tower
/// transmission. That stride existed to throttle *console logging* to roughly
/// 1 Hz at 24 fps; transmission was coupled to the same condition by
/// accident, which is what capped delivery at 24/30 ≈ 0.8 fps. A stride is
/// also the wrong unit — it silently multiplies any change in the source
/// rate, whereas the pipeline's actual requirement is expressed in delivered
/// frames per second and holds whether DAT produces 15, 24 or 30 fps.
///
/// Selection is deadline-based rather than "has `interval` elapsed since the
/// last selection". The latter aliases badly: at a 24 fps source and a 12 fps
/// target the elapsed-time boundary lands exactly on a frame arrival, so a
/// fraction of a millisecond of jitter rejects every other candidate and
/// halves the delivered rate. Here the deadline advances by whole intervals
/// and a frame is admitted once it is within `tolerance` of that deadline,
/// which keeps the mean on target under jitter.
///

/// is unit testable without a camera, a timer, or real elapsed time.
