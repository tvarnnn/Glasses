/// iPhone-side health signals for the streaming session: thermal pressure,
/// Low Power Mode, and battery.
///
/// Exists because a five-minute physical run left the glasses noticeably warm
/// and there was no way to tell, after the fact, whether the phone had been
/// throttling too. A sender rate that decays over minutes and a device that
/// heats over minutes are the same shape, and without telemetry they are
/// indistinguishable from each other — and from a network that simply got
/// worse.
///
/// Deliberately **only** the phone. The glasses have their own thermal
/// telemetry, but it arrives through Meta DAT, which by
/// docs/02-DEVELOPMENT-RULES.md Rule 1 stays behind `GlassesConnection`; it is
/// published there as `glassesThermalLevel`. Nothing here talks to DAT.
///
/// Every value is read from the OS, never derived or estimated, and anything
/// the OS declines to report stays `nil` — Rule 3.
///
/// Note that constructing this switches on `UIDevice` battery monitoring
/// process-wide, and `ProjectManager` constructs it unconditionally while the
/// only consumer today is the DEBUG-only developer surface. Battery monitoring
/// is cheap, and the alternative — another `#if DEBUG` seam through
/// `ProjectManager` — buys less than it costs. Worth revisiting if this type
/// ever grows a more expensive observation.
