/// The panel every cartridge workspace uses to say that the Tower has nothing
/// for it.
///
/// ## Why this is shared and the workspaces are not
///
/// Four workspaces need to render "there is nothing here yet", and it is the
/// only screen state any of them can reach today. Four hand-written versions
/// would drift into four different explanations of the same single fact — and
/// the fact is *shared*: the Tower has no module runtime, so no cartridge has a
/// contract. One panel, one wording, one place to change when that stops being
/// true.
///
/// What is emphatically **not** shared is the workspace itself. A generic
/// cartridge screen driven by descriptor metadata is the plugin framework this
/// work is forbidden to build; each workspace stays its own file with its own
/// layout, and borrows this panel the way it borrows `SectionLabel`.
///
/// ## What it refuses to draw
///
/// - **No metric tiles.** Placeholder values render as "—", and a grid of
///   dashes reads as *broken* rather than as *early*. Prose carries the same
///   information and creates no dead UI to explain away later.
/// - **No spinner** unless the phase is `.waiting`. A progress indicator claims
///   work is underway; in `.unsupported` nothing is underway and never will be
///   without a Tower change.
/// - **No "coming soon".** It states what exists now and what would have to
///   change, without promising a date the roadmap does not contain.

    /// `CartridgeAvailability.explanation(cartridgeName:)` or a failure's
    /// message. Never composed here: this view does not know enough to write
    /// it, and a view that guesses at an explanation is how "not built yet"
    /// becomes "something went wrong".
