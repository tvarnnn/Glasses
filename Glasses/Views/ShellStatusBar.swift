/// The persistent infrastructure readout: glasses, camera, Tower.

/// Lives in the shell, above the workspace and outside the workspace switch, so
/// no cartridge can hide it and no workspace change can rebuild it. That is
/// deliberate and privacy-relevant: because leaving a workspace does *not* stop
/// a running camera, the camera's state has to be visible from everywhere,
/// including from Home after the user has navigated away from the workspace
/// that started it.
///
/// Tapping opens `ConnectionSheet`, which is where every manual recovery
/// control now lives. Keeping that route open matters — the Tower's automatic
/// reconnect schedule is bounded and deliberately gives up, so there has to be
/// a way for a person to say "try again".
