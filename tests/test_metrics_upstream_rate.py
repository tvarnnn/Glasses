"""Upstream observation-rate instrumentation.

The 2026-08-21 first physical-glasses remote run delivered 0.8 fps to the
Tower. Diagnosing that required hand arithmetic over log lines: dividing
the last observed `seq` by the session duration to recover the capture
rate, then dividing again by the frame count to recover the sender's
sampling stride. These tests lock in metrics that make the Tower report
both numbers directly, so a future run is diagnosable without inferring
sender behavior from `seq_gap_total`.

Both figures are derived from `source_seq` (the DAT/capture frame index),
which falls back to `seq` for every sender that exists today -- see
tower/frames.py and
docs/superpowers/handoffs/2026-08-20-source-seq-tx-seq-split.md.
