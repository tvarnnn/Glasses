"""A dead connection must not disarm a live connection's recording.

The race is not hypothetical and the timing is not close. uvicorn does not
learn a WebSocket is dead for 20-40 seconds (`ws_ping_interval` and
`ws_ping_timeout` are both 20 s), while iOS reconnects in 0.5 s and
re-sends `stream_start` -- `handoff.md` section 6.4 documents that backoff
schedule, and section 9.3 says a repeat `stream_start` on a fresh
connection is the EXPECTED case on this link, not an edge case.

So on any WiFi hiccup the ordering is:

    new connection arms a recording
    ...then the old connection's `finally` block finally runs
    ...and stops it

The recorder is one process-global object shared by every connection, so
before this guard it could not tell the two apart. Measured consequence:
the phone streams on, the Tower answers every frame_result, `/health`
reports `recording: false`, and zero frames reach disk for the rest of the
walk. Silently -- which is worse than losing the capture, because it looks
like success.
