"""Geometry correctness against exact synthetic ground truth.

SYNTHETIC, NOT PHYSICAL. These assert that the geometry CODE is correct --
that a known rotation comes back as that rotation, that a degenerate pair
is refused. They assert nothing about the Ray-Ban camera, whose optics,
distortion, rolling shutter and exposure behaviour are all untested and
must remain so until physical footage exists.

Tolerances are motion-dependent on purpose. Lateral motion recovers
translation direction to a fraction of a degree; forward motion -- which
is what a walking person actually does -- puts the epipole inside the
image and was measured at up to 9.7 deg on clean synthetic features. A
single global tolerance would be either vacuous or wrong.

        the comparison aligns first. Measured residual at the time of
        writing: 1.32% of path length over a 1.2 m walk, with the 2x step
        recovered as 1.79x rather than 2.00x. That error is real and is
        exactly what bundle adjustment would reduce; the bound here is
        deliberately loose so it documents current behaviour rather than
        freezing it.
