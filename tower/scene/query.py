"""Asking the scene a question, and getting a refusal when it cannot answer.

The brief's four example questions, and one rule that governs all of them:
**an answer must never be more confident than the evidence.**

    How many people are in this room?          -> count, from TRACKS
    Where is the desk?                         -> camera-relative position
    Where is a chair?                          -> same
    How many appear to be facing my direction? -> orientation, or a refusal

The third question hides a trap the others do not. If orientation is
disabled -- and it is, by default, because it costs 744 ms a frame --
then "how many people are facing me" has **no answer**, and returning 0
would be a lie of exactly the kind Core Principle 3 forbids: an
observation gap reported as an observation of absence.

Nothing here reads or writes a store. There is no store.
