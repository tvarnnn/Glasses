"""Is there a page-like region in this frame, and does it hold text?

Cheap enough to run on every frame, because that is the only way the
expensive path can be rare. Classical, not learned: a page is a bright,
roughly rectangular, roughly convex region, and a contour finder answers
that in a couple of milliseconds without a model, a download or a GPU.

**Three gates, not one.** A closed laptop lid, a picture frame, a monitor
bezel and a blank whiteboard are all page-shaped. Rectangle detection
alone would call every one of them a document.

The second gate asks whether the interior has rows of ink. That is
necessary and, on its own, badly insufficient: **venetian blinds, brick
courses, floor tiles and a striped shirt all produce rows of dark pixels
just as reliably as text does**, and an adversarial review drove a brick
wall all the way through detection, dwell, OCR and persistence.

The third gate is what separates them, and it comes from what text
actually IS. A line of text is made of glyphs -- many short dark runs with
gaps between them. A slat, a mortar course or a stripe is ONE run
spanning the width. Counting dark/light transitions along each inky row
tells them apart with an enormous margin (measured below).
