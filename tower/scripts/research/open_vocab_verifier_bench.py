"""Can an open-vocabulary model tell a remote from a laptop keyboard?

THE QUESTION, AND WHY IT IS THIS ONE.

Reading the crops the shipped detector produced over the real corpus
found that its labels are unreliable for exactly the classes this
cartridge is for. A ceiling fan is `airplane` at 0.99 and `scissors` at
0.93. A white door is `refrigerator` at 0.95. The three highest-scoring
`remote` sightings in 18,821 frames are all laptop keyboards.

So widening the class list requires a SECOND OPINION, and the only
honest way to choose one is to measure it against crops whose true label
is known. `data/captures/` carries no annotation, so the labels here come
from a human reading contact sheets
(`scripts/research/sighting_contact_sheet.py`) -- 82 crops from classes
where every inspected tile was right or every one was wrong, plus the
two mixed classes that matter most, labelled tile by tile.

That is a small set and it is stated as one. It is also the only ground
truth about this corpus that exists anywhere in this repository.

WHAT IS ASKED OF EACH MODEL.

Not "detect everything". The funnel has already produced a crop and a
proposed label; the question is whether the proposed label survives. So
each model is given the crop and a fixed vocabulary of object names, and
is judged on whether the proposed name comes FIRST. That is exactly the
shape `VerificationQueue` needs, and it is a much easier question than
open-set detection -- which is the point: the expensive stage should be
asked the narrowest question that answers the need.

    python scripts/research/open_vocab_verifier_bench.py \\
        --detections analysis/corpus-detections.jsonl \\
        --captures ../../Glasses/tower/data/captures \\
        --out analysis/verifier-bench.json

It reads the corpus and writes only its report and its contact sheets.
The sheets contain crops of raw first-person imagery and must not be
committed; `analysis/` is gitignored.
