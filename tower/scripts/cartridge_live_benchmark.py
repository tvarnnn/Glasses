"""What a live cartridge costs a Tower that is also serving frames.

Two cartridges now attach a worker thread to the frame path, and the
question a deployment actually has is not "how fast is the detector" --
`scripts/scene_benchmark.py` answers that -- but **"can this keep up with
the glasses, and does it grow?"** Those are different questions and this
script answers the second.

WHAT IT MEASURES, AND WHY EACH ONE

- **Sustained throughput against a real delivery rate.** Frames are fed
  at the corpus's own measured interval (83.5 ms, 12.0 fps) rather than
  as fast as possible. Feeding faster measures the harness; feeding at
  the real rate measures whether the worker is ever behind.
- **`frames_skipped`.** The single number that says whether a Tower is
  overloaded. There is one slot and the newest frame wins, so a busy
  worker drops frames -- and for Scene Understanding that also stretches
  what the tracker's `max_misses` means, because it is a frame count
  derived from a 1.0 s absence at 12 fps.
- **Per-frame service time**, measured on the worker, not end to end:
  the interesting figure is how long the cartridge occupies its thread,
  because that is what determines whether it keeps up.
- **Event-loop occupancy.** How long `offer_frame` itself takes. It runs
  on the event loop, inline, per frame, and every microsecond there is
  paid by every connection.
- **Resident memory before, during and after.** A live session that grows
  over a long walk is the failure that does not show up in a short test,
  and both cartridges hold state that could: a tracker's track list, a
  dwell's retained frames.
- **CPU seconds**, so "40% of a core" is a measurement rather than an
  estimate.

WHAT IT DOES NOT MEASURE

Accuracy. Nothing here compares a count or a transcript against ground
truth; `scripts/scene_benchmark.py` and
`scripts/document_memory_benchmark.py` own that, and the detector's
recall against an oracle is measured in
`docs/superpowers/research/2026-08-26-detector-oracle-and-the-size-floor.md`.

NOTHING IS WRITTEN unless `--document-root` is given, and Scene
Understanding cannot write at all.
