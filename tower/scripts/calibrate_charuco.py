"""Recover camera intrinsics from ChArUco board views.

This is the switch that moves World Builder from "no poses, and it says
so" to "poses". Nothing else in the system changes what the product is by
as much.

ChArUco rather than a plain checkerboard because the wearer cannot see the
frame: ChArUco identifies each corner individually, so a partially visible
or partly occluded board still contributes, where a plain checkerboard
needs the whole grid.

    # print this, mount it flat and rigid
    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe scripts/calibrate_charuco.py --generate-board board.png

    # then calibrate from frames captured THROUGH THE REAL PIPELINE
    .venv\\Scripts\\python.exe scripts/calibrate_charuco.py \\
        --frames data/captures/<capture_id>/frames

With no --out, the result lands in the intrinsics store under the world
root -- `data/world_builder/intrinsics/<width>x<height>.json` -- which is
exactly where `world_build_session.py` looks it up by the OBSERVED frame
size. That default is the whole point: before it existed, calibrating and
then building required the operator to remember a flag at both ends, and
forgetting either produced a silently pose-free world. See
`docs/CALIBRATION.md` for the physical procedure.

WHAT THIS HAS AND HAS NOT BEEN VALIDATED AGAINST
------------------------------------------------
The code path is unit-tested against synthetically rendered board views
and recovers a known focal length to within ~0.3%. That validates the
wiring -- which genuinely matters, because `calibrateCameraCharuco` does
NOT exist in OpenCV 5 and the working sequence is CharucoDetector ->
matchImagePoints -> calibrateCamera.

It has NOT been validated against:

- any real lens. The synthetic input is a perfect pinhole with zero
  distortion, so the distortion-model choice -- the parameter most likely
  to be wrong on a ~100-degree wearable lens -- is completely unexercised.
- real JPEG compression, motion blur, rolling shutter, or auto-exposure.
- DAT's adaptive resolution ladder, which switches mid-stream.

Even noise-free, the principal point came back ~2.5 px off truth. It is
the weakly-constrained parameter before any real-world effect is added.
Treat a first real calibration as provisional and check its reprojection
RMS and view count before trusting it.
