"""Rebuild a recorded physical walk, deterministically, from raw frames.

WHY THIS EXISTS

Every World Builder finding before this script was argued from a world
already on disk. That is enough to say what the pipeline DID and useless
for saying what a change would DO, because the only way to re-measure was
to put the glasses back on. A registration change that can only be
validated by another walk is a change nobody dares make.

This replays a walk instead. It reproduces the two physical sessions of
2026-08-29 exactly -- same frames observed, same keyframes accepted, same
rejection histogram, same segment count, same solved poses, same points:

    worldA  1008 frames -> 229 keyframes / 23 segments / 100 solved / 9145 points
    worldB  1074 frames -> 218 keyframes / 36 segments / 108 solved / 13050 points

matching the persisted sessions 815c88ba (world 991e5a15) and 7864d3b3
(world af47007c) figure for figure. That equality is the whole warrant
for the tool: an offline number may then be compared with a physical one.

WHAT A "WALK" IS ON DISK

One walk is usually SEVERAL captures. The Tower mints a capture at
`stream_start`, so a transport disconnect ends one and the reconnect
begins the next, while the World Builder follower keeps a single session
across the gap (under the 90 s new-walk bound). Both sessions here are
three captures. `CASES` records which, in time order; the frame numbering
across them is disjoint and increasing, so a merged directory in sorted
order is the walk's true frame order.

WHAT IT IS NOT

`--frames` reads a directory, not the capture journal, so `source_seq`,
`tx_seq` and receipt time are the enumeration index rather than the
recorder's own values. Nothing in keyframe selection or geometry reads
them -- which is why the replay comes out exact -- but a transport
question must not be asked of this tool. Use `--follow-capture` for that.

Staging is by hard link, never a copy: the frames are the evidence, and a
replay must not be able to cost a gigabyte or to modify them.
