r"""Remember which objects were in view, and when.

Runs in a SEPARATE PROCESS from the Tower, like every other cartridge
producer here. That is what makes this slice possible at all: Object
Memory has been considered blocked on whether a module lifecycle can
bound a synchronous model load, and a follower that tails a capture
journal needs no module lifecycle, no load timeout and no module slot.
The Tower's frame path pays nothing for this.

Frame sources:

  --frames DIR          a recorded capture directory, or any directory of
                        .jpg files. If the directory has a `frames.jsonl`
                        journal it is read instead of globbing, so the
                        real receipt times and source_seq survive; a bare
                        directory of jpegs has no timestamps and the
                        records say so.
  --follow-capture DIR  tail a capture the Tower is writing RIGHT NOW, so
                        objects are remembered while the wearer walks

WHAT THIS WILL AND WILL NOT REMEMBER

The classes `tower/object_memory/classes.py` admits, which is not one
list but two. `laptop` and `cell phone` are written on the detector's
word, because 36 of 36 inspected crops of them over the real corpus were
right. A dozen more -- `remote`, `backpack`, `bottle`, `cup` and the
rest -- are written only if a VERIFIER agrees, because inspection found
the same detector calling a ceiling fan `airplane` at 0.99 and a laptop
keyboard `remote` at 0.87. With `--verifier none`, which is the default,
nothing in the second list is ever written and this script behaves
exactly as the one that was physically validated.

`person` is excluded, and there is deliberately NO FLAG to widen the
list: re-admitting `person` commits the project to persisting a record
per detected bystander, which is an open ruling no human has settled
here. A command-line switch would let that decision happen by accident.

A record says a CATEGORY was visible over a span of time, with a
confidence. It is not a claim that the object is there now, not a claim
about WHICH laptop, and not a position in a room -- `spatial_ref` is null
and stays null.

The unit is a SIGHTING: a run of frames in which a class stayed in view,
broken by a gap of more than three seconds. A record is written once the
sighting is three frames old -- about a quarter of a second -- stamped
with the FIRST frame, so a killed session loses at most that. What the
sighting later becomes (its duration, its frame count, its strongest
look) is folded back into the same record rather than becoming a second
one. None of the scores is a calibrated probability.

`--retention-days` is recorded in the store's manifest at first append,
and every later read clamps to min(persisted, requested). A reader can
narrow that window; nothing a reader passes can widen it.

AND EACH RECORD KEEPS A PICTURE THIS CARTRIDGE OWNS.

`--keep-imagery`, on by default, writes one small filtered crop per
record under `<root>/keyframes/`. Without it a record's only picture is
a frame in `data/captures/`, which this cartridge does not own and whose
lifetime it does not set -- so the first thing that prunes captures
takes the picture out of every memory at once, which is a race rather
than a retention policy. The owned crop is pruned when the record
expires and deleted by `object_query.py --purge-all`.

It needs a face-detection model and FAILS CLOSED without one: no model
means no keyframes at all, never an unfiltered crop on disk, and this
script says so once at start rather than refusing quietly all walk.
Measured at ~11.7 KB a record, about 4.3 MB an hour of walking.

    THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES, AND IT WAS COSTING REAL MEMORIES.

    Pressing Stop (or Pause) in the app reaches
    `CartridgeSession._detach` -> `CaptureWorkerSupervisor.detach` ->
    `Popen.terminate()`. On Windows that is `TerminateProcess`: no
    unwinding, no `finally`, no `atexit`. So `engine.release()` -- which
    is the ONLY thing that calls `finish()` on the open sightings, writes
    the ones that matured, and refreshes the duration, `frame_count` and
    `best_*` of the ones already on disk -- never ran.

    What a wearer lost by pressing the button they were told to press:
    every sighting still open at that instant. A laptop that had been in
    view for the whole walk and was still in view when they stopped is
    exactly the sighting that is open, so this was biased towards losing
    the MOST-seen objects rather than the least.

    The old detach grace was zero, and its comment said why: "nothing
    SIGNALS the producer: it is a follower tailing a journal that is
    still being written, so it has no reason to stop and never does. The
    wait measured 5.01 seconds every single time." That was true, and it
    was true because of this file, not because of the supervisor. Now
    something does signal it, the wait ends when the work is done, and
    the grace is worth having again.

    WHY A FLAG AND NOT WORK IN THE HANDLER.

    A signal handler runs between bytecodes on whatever thread the
    interpreter chooses. `engine.release()` takes the store's writer lock
    and joins the verification queue's worker; doing that from a handler
    is how a shutdown deadlocks. So the handler sets a bool and returns,
    the frame loop notices within one frame, and the ordinary
    `finally: engine.release()` does the work on the main thread exactly
    as it does when a capture closes by itself.

    WHICH SIGNALS.

    `SIGTERM` and `SIGINT` on POSIX. On Windows `SIGTERM` is not
    deliverable between processes at all -- `Popen.terminate()` is
    `TerminateProcess` and never becomes a Python signal -- so the
    supervisor sends `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` to the process group it
    deliberately created for each worker, and that arrives here as
    `SIGBREAK`. Registering all four is cheap and means neither side has
    to be right about the platform.
