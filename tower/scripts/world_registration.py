"""Cross-segment registration, offline. Estimate a Sim3 per segment.

World Builder reconstructs in segments, each an independent two-view-seeded
solve with its own origin and its own arbitrary unit -- camera spans across
one real walk range 1.000 to 86.74, an ~87x spread. The viewer therefore
cannot draw a map; it draws disconnected fragments. This script attempts the
missing step: a per-segment `T_world_segment` similarity transform.

It is ANALYSIS, not a production path. It reads a world and writes nothing
into it. Whether the pipeline should compute this on every build is a later
decision that these numbers exist to inform.

-- The property that governs the design -----------------------------------

Reprojection error does not catch fabrication. Measured on the real walk
(docs/superpowers/research/2026-08-26-cross-segment-registration.md section
6): segment pair (30,50) fits at 1.62 px median with 88% of correspondences
under 3 px, and its scale is wrong by a factor of 3.2. Segment 6 registered
into its OWN frame -- where the true scale is exactly 1.0 by construction --
fits at 0.75 px and returns 0.674.

The reason is geometric, not a tuning failure. A wrong scale paired with a
compensating translation reprojects perfectly whenever the target segment
has no internal parallax, and "the wearer stood still and turned" is the
common case in this corpus. So a gate resting on fit quality will ship
plausible, wrong maps -- which is the failure mode this project cares most
about.

Registration therefore rests on INDEPENDENT AGREEMENT, and the types below
enforce that rather than describing it:

  * `DirectedFit` is one direction's solve. It carries every fit-quality
    number -- reprojection, correspondence count, ambiguity -- and has no
    method, property or flag that yields a decision. You cannot ask it
    whether it is good enough, because it does not know and cannot know.

  * `MutualEvidence` can only be built from two DirectedFits in OPPOSITE
    directions, and refuses the same object twice. Constructing it is the
    act of obtaining independent evidence.

  * `admit()` accepts `MutualEvidence` and nothing else, by an explicit
    type check that names the reason. Handing it a DirectedFit raises.

Adding a fit-quality-only path later means deleting that type check and
widening that signature, in a file whose tests assert both. That is the
point: it should be hard to do by accident.

    It said a 3-D/3-D correspondence needs a landmark on BOTH sides, that
    the association density ranges 0.54% to 52%, and that the product

    mutually-triangulated landmark pairs, and 43 of that walk's 253
    segment pairs clear ten. Density is not the obstacle.

    The real reason is depth, and it is worse than a density problem
    because more data does not fix it. A 3-D/3-D similarity is DRIVEN by
    landmark depth; PnP is driven by bearings, which are accurate, plus
    the target's own camera baseline. `landmark_gate` admits a landmark
    at `min_parallax_deg`, which by construction is around 100% depth
    uncertainty, so a segment's points are only ever as good as that
    bound. Measured on halves of segment 29 that re-triangulate
    independently from a known-identical truth, the landmarks the two
    halves share land **1.05x scene depth apart at the median**, and a

    identity by 28 inliers to 2. Four of eight such known-answer cases

    THIS IS THE FIX FOR THE FAILURE THAT KEPT THE DRAWER WALK IN PIECES,
    and it is worth stating precisely, because the symptom pointed
    somewhere else entirely.

    `_pnp_observations` will place ANY target keyframe for which twelve
    of the source's landmarks survive RANSAC. On repetitive indoor
    texture a keyframe sharing no physical view with the source still
    clears that bar on aliased matches, and -- this is the part that
    hurts -- the fabricated cameras are MUTUALLY consistent, so nothing
    downstream notices. Because a Sim3's scale is exactly the ratio of
    the placed constellation's span to the target's own span, collapsing
    part of the constellation reports a smaller scale.

    Measured against a known answer, by splitting ONE segment into two
    halves that share a frame and a unit by construction so the truth is
    scale 1.0 exactly: segment 29 of the 2026-08-29 drawer walk came
    back at 0.30 -- 3.04x wrong -- while agreeing on rotation to 0.62
    deg, reprojecting at 2.48 px, and reporting a scale ambiguity of
    2.04. Every clause in `admit()` except reciprocity passed a fit that
    was provably three times wrong. Seven of that split's eight target
    cameras were fabricated: they cleared PnP on 15-34 mutually
    consistent false correspondences and were placed with centre errors
    of 4.8 to 12.3 against a scene depth of 27.6.

    The same signature produced the real refusal. Pair (14,29) is the
    walk's return leg meeting its outbound leg -- 20,267 verified
    inliers between the two best-conditioned segments in the capture --
    and it was refused because the directions disagreed on scale by
    2.4x. Restricting the forward solve to segment 29's frames 0-11,
    which are the ones that actually overlap segment 14, gives 1.0031
    against the reverse's 0.9408. The disagreement was never a statement
    about the room. It was ten cameras that had no business in the fit.

    So the filter asks each placed camera to state the scale itself
    (`_camera_scale`) and keeps the largest agreeing group, weighted by
    how much evidence each camera brought.

    WHAT IT DOES AND DOES NOT GUARANTEE. It only ever removes cameras,
    so `min_cameras` gets harder to satisfy and no pair is admitted on
    MORE cameras than before. That is the whole of the structural
    guarantee, and it is narrower than it first looks: dropping outliers
    also TIGHTENS the surviving fit, so `scale_ambiguity`,
    `reprojection_px` and `rotation_disagreement_deg` can all improve.
    They do, dramatically -- on world `6502da15` pair (6,7) the filter
    takes ambiguity from 207.38 to 1.00 and reprojection from 29.88 px
    to 1.90 px, and that pair goes from refused by four clauses to
    admitted at exactly `cameras = 3`. So this is NOT "it can only
    refuse more". It is "it removes cameras that were measuring the
    wrong thing, and the remaining clauses then describe the fit that is
    actually left".

    What holds the safety is therefore not the narrowing but
    RECIPROCITY, which the filter cannot forge. The two directions PnP
    different segments' landmarks into different images, so a fabricated
    group in one has no counterpart in the other. Tested directly: force
    the filter onto the FABRICATED group of (14,29) and try every
    reverse-camera subset of size >= 3 -- none of the 16 reaches
    reciprocity within 10% (best 0.4172). Across 325 cross-world pairs
    from six different rooms, 74 of which reached the gate, zero are
    admitted with the filter on or off.

    No threshold moves and `admit()` is untouched. The recall comes from
    measuring the right cameras.
