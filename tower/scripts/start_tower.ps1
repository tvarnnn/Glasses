.SYNOPSIS
    Start the Glasses Tower. The one command for ordinary development.

.DESCRIPTION
    Preflights the environment, diagnoses (never silently kills) whatever
    owns the port, prints the configuration that will actually be in
    effect, and then runs uvicorn against tower.main:app from the tower
    root.

    No venv activation, no second terminal, no manual environment
    variables: .env is handed to uvicorn with --env-file, which loads it in
    Config.__init__ -- before the app is imported -- so the TOWER_* values
    reach get_settings() in tower/config.py.

.PARAMETER Port
    TCP port to listen on. Default 8000.

.PARAMETER BindHost
    Interface to bind. Default 0.0.0.0, which is what the phone needs.
    Named -BindHost rather than -Host because $Host is an automatic
    PowerShell variable and a -Host parameter shadows it.

.PARAMETER Reload
    Enable uvicorn's auto-reload. Development convenience only.

.PARAMETER Force
    If the port is already held, attempt to stop the owning process.
    Off by default: killing a process you did not identify is not a thing
    a start script should do on its own.

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\start_tower.ps1

.EXAMPLE
    powershell -NoProfile -File scripts\start_tower.ps1 -Port 8001 -Reload
