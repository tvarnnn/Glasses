"""What a built world actually amounts to: coherence, and whether it is honest.

WHY THIS EXISTS

`world_build_session.py` reports segments, solved poses and points.
None of those is the product question. A walk that reports 30 segments
and 30,382 points can still be eighteen disconnected islands the wearer
cannot use, and a walk that reports ONE segment can be one confidently
wrong room. The two numbers that matter are

    how much of the geometry sits in ONE coordinate frame,

and

    does that geometry reproject.

The first without the second is the failure mode this whole line of work
has to avoid: coherence bought by accepting poses that are not true.
So this tool refuses to report either alone. Every run prints the
dominant-component share AND the reprojection distribution of the
published support rows, per segment and in aggregate.

WHAT IT MEASURES, AND FROM WHAT

Everything is read cold from a persisted world. Nothing is re-solved, so
a number here is a statement about what shipped, not about what a fresh
run might do.

  segments / keyframes / poses          derived/manifest.json
  root vs cascaded refusals             derived/manifest.json
  per-segment pose status               derived/<session>/poses.json
  per-segment points                    derived/<session>/points.json
  connected components                  derived/<session>/placements.json,
                                        via world_registration.admitted_components
  reprojection error                    support.json rows re-projected through
                                        poses.json, with the 2-D feature
                                        positions recovered by re-detecting ORB
                                        on the stored keyframe

That last one costs an ORB detection per keyframe -- the same cost
`world_registration.read_segments` already pays -- so `--no-reprojection`
is offered for a quick structural read. It is off by default on purpose:
a coherence number published without its quality number is exactly the
misleading artifact this file exists to prevent.

REPROJECTION, PRECISELY

A support row says (segment, frame, feature, point). The landmark is
projected through that frame's own pose, in the segment's own frame, and
compared with the pixel of that feature. Units are pixels at the
capture's resolution. Rows whose landmark falls behind the camera are
counted separately as `behind_camera` rather than folded into the
distribution, because a negative depth has no meaningful pixel distance
and averaging one in would flatter the result.

The bar to read against is `classical.PNP_REPROJECTION_ERROR_PX` (3.0),
which is the threshold `solvePnPRansac` used to admit these very rows.
A median well under it means the published association is the one the
solver believed; a p99 far above it means rows are being published that
no solve would have accepted.
