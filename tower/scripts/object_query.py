r"""Ask Object Memory when it last saw something.

Deliberately independent of any voice path, like Document Memory's query
CLI: a Siri shortcut or a wake word would sit ABOVE this, and building
the voice layer first would have made the memory untestable.

    --last-seen laptop   when was a laptop last in view
    --purge-all          really delete every observation

ON "WHERE"

The obvious question is "when and WHERE did I last see my laptop", and
half of it cannot be answered. Observations carry `spatial_ref: None` --
the field is reserved, never populated, and actively nulled on read.
Nothing in this slice knows where anything is in a room.

So "where" is answered as a FRAME REFERENCE: which capture, which frame
sequence number, which camera. That is a pointer back into the recording,
not a place. This CLI says so on every answer rather than letting a
capture id be mistaken for a location.

Nor is it a claim the object is still there. It is a record that a
CATEGORY was visible once -- not that this is YOUR laptop, and not that
absence of a record means absence of the laptop.

ON RETENTION

`--retention-days` is a request, not an authority. The store records the
window it was WRITTEN under, and every read is clamped to
min(persisted, requested): this CLI can narrow the window it sees and
cannot widen it. Asking for 3650 days, or 0 meaning forever, against a
store written under the 30-day default still gets you 30 days.

ON WHAT DELETION REACHES

`--purge-all` deletes every observation this cartridge holds. It does not
touch `data/captures/`, and a record's session_id + frame_seq points
straight into it. The imagery is governed by capture-side retention,
which is not Object Memory's to give away or to promise.

# This used to be `Path("data/object_memory")` -- relative, resolved
# against whatever directory the operator happened to be standing in, and
# never consulting TOWER_OBSERVATION_ROOT at all. `config.py` exists to
# stop exactly that, and says why at length: on 2026-08-26 the producer
# defaulted to one directory and the web process to another, and a real
# 2,203-frame walk was remembered into a store every HTTP request
# answered 404 about. "Two defaults for one directory is not a
# configuration choice; it is a bug with a settings file in front of it."
#
# `object_memory_session.py` was fixed then. This file was not, and it is
# the worse place to miss, because THIS is where deletion lives. A wearer
# asks for their object memory to be erased; an operator runs
# `--purge-all` from the tower root; `ObservationStore.purge()` on a
# directory nothing ever wrote to removes nothing and reports success,
# because `unlink(missing_ok=True)` cannot tell "already gone" from "never
# here". Exit code 0, `observations_removed: 0`, and the records still on
# disk and still being served.
#
# An explicit `--root` still wins, and `TOWER_OBSERVATION_ROOT` still wins
# over the default, so an operator who chose a directory is obeyed.
