"""Face redaction applied BEFORE a keyframe is written to disk.

The platform's privacy rule is a pipeline, and the order in it is the
whole point:

    raw sensor data -> necessary ephemeral perception -> derived
    structured information -> privacy transformation -> persistence

World Builder is the one module that retains raw imagery, so it is the one
module where the transformation has somewhere to happen. This runs at
`engine._persist_keyframe`, the single choke point every persisted pixel
already passes through -- the same property `capture.write_frame` has and
for the same reason: a rule enforced in one place is a rule, and a rule
enforced by everyone remembering is a hope.

**Before persistence, not on read.** Redacting on the way out would leave
the raw frames on disk, where a later bug, a backup, a forensic recovery
or a policy change can still reach them. That is a display filter, not a
privacy transformation, and the rule above puts the transformation before
the write.

WHY THIS IS AFFORDABLE, MEASURED
--------------------------------
The obvious objection is that the reconstruction is built from these
pixels, so redacting them damages the geometry. Measured on 10 synthetic
scene seeds, full pipeline (observe -> stop -> build), blurring a centred
region of the frame:

    blur area   ORB features   keyframes   poses solved   points
    0%  (base)   1406 +- 31      5.0/5.0      4.0/4.0      1567
    5%           1378 (98%)      5.0/5.0      4.0/4.0      1425 (-9%)
    15%          1288 (92%)      5.0/5.0      4.0/4.0      1365 (-13%)
    30%          1103 (78%)      5.0/5.0      4.0/4.0      1162 (-26%)

**Keyframe acceptance and pose solving were completely insensitive** --
5.0 of 5.0 keyframes and 4 of 4 poses at every level, with a
byte-identical rejection histogram. Only feature density and the point
count degrade, and they degrade smoothly.

And a real face is small: measured detector boxes at 640x360 have a median
area of 1.74% of the frame, 4.45% after the head dilation below. So the
honest cost of one redacted face is the 5% row -- no keyframes lost, no
poses lost, about 9% of the point cloud.

WHY THIS DETECTOR
-----------------
YuNet is already compiled into the OpenCV this project ships
(`cv2.FaceDetectorYN`); only its weights were missing. Measured at 640x360
with the settings below: **17.4 ms per frame**, 100/100 on distinct real
faces from scikit-image's LFW subset, 0 false positives on 40 face-free
frames, and it holds through 45 degrees of head tilt, mirrors, faces on
screens, and motion blur.

Rejected alternatives, all measured:

- **scikit-image's LBP cascade** (already on disk, via easyocr's
  scikit-image). Works, needs no download -- and costs 300-524 ms per
  frame and goes blind above about 15 degrees of head tilt, which is
  anyone looking down at a phone.
- **The COCO person detector plus pose keypoints** we already load for
  Scene Understanding. A head box from keypoints did cover 100% of the
  face in every case tested -- but at 998 ms per frame, ~57x YuNet, and it
  cannot redact a face with no body in frame, which is a common shape for
  first-person capture. The cheaper heuristic, "the upper quarter of the
  person box", leaks 33-68% of the face and is worst exactly when the
  person is occluded. Both rejected.
- **mediapipe**, which pulls `opencv-contrib-python` alongside our
  headless build -- the same collision this project already rejected
  `rapidocr_onnxruntime` for. **facenet-pytorch**, which downgrades torch,
  torchvision, numpy and pillow. Both rejected without installing.

WHAT MAY BE CLAIMED
-------------------
Not "faces removed". The detector has measured hard false negatives: a
face occluded more than about 60%, and a face rotated about 90 degrees in
plane. Profile and rear views are a known blind spot of this detector
class and were not testable here.

So the label records **what ran**, not what was achieved -- the detector's
identity and its threshold, so a reader can look up its limits. A session
says `faces-detected-and-filled/yunet-2023mar@0.30`, never "redacted",
"anonymised" or "privacy-safe". `retains_raw_imagery` stays true and the
privacy tags stay exactly as they were: bodies, clothing, room contents
and any undetected face are all still in the image.
