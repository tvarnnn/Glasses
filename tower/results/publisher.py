"""Fan-out of cartridge snapshots to subscribers, with hard bounds.

Three decisions shape everything here, and all three follow from one fact:
**a World Builder status is a SNAPSHOT, not a log entry.** It is recomputed
from files on disk that are themselves the durable record. Nothing is lost
by discarding an older snapshot, because a newer one answers the same
question better.

So:

1. **There is no queue.** Each subscription owns exactly ONE slot holding
   the most recent snapshot it has not yet been sent. A new snapshot
   REPLACES whatever is in that slot. Memory per subscription is therefore
   one payload, not N -- and the "unbounded event queue" the brief warns
   about is not bounded here, it is absent by construction. A bounded
   queue of N would have been worse than either: it drops the NEWEST
   updates once full, which is precisely backwards for a freshness-first
   channel.

2. **One poller serves everyone.** The reader is per-app, not per
   connection, so ten subscribers watching one world cost one disk read
   per interval, not ten. It runs only while at least one subscription
   exists: a Tower nobody is watching does no work.

3. **A slow consumer is dropped, never tolerated indefinitely.** Sends are
   bounded by `SEND_TIMEOUT_S`. A client that stops reading gets its
   subscription closed with a reason. This matters because the frame path
   shares the socket: one TCP stream means a client that is not reading
   blocks everything, and a result send must never be the thing holding
   that up without limit.

The poll loop touches no cartridge state. It reads files. It cannot alter
capture cadence, frame routing, World Builder processing or cartridge
correctness, because it has no reference to any of them.

# is measured.
