class SessionMetrics:
    """Tracks measurements for a single WebSocket connection's frame stream.

    A new instance must be created per connection, never reused across a
    reconnect: a new session is a new observation stream, not a
    continuation of the previous one (07-PLATFORM-CONSTRAINTS.md,
    Limitation 4).

    ``seq_gap_total`` is a RAW, causally-neutral count of discontinuities
    in the received ``seq`` field. It is deliberately NOT named/labeled as
    "frames lost in transit". Confirmed 2026-08-19: the current iOS sender
    assigns ``seq`` from the DAT/source capture-frame index (``frameCount``
    of incoming VideoFrames), but only forwards roughly 1-in-30 of them
    (a throttled capture -> transmit branch), so the Tower normally
    receives seq like 1, 30, 60, 90, ... by design. Under the CURRENT wire
    protocol (seq, width, height, format, data -- no separate
    transmission-attempt counter), a gap in ``seq`` cannot be attributed
    to any single cause: it may be intentional sender-side sampling,
    a sender-side drop, or genuine network/transit loss, and those look
    identical on the wire. Do not report this number as network loss.
    See 07-PLATFORM-CONSTRAINTS.md Limitation 9 for the future
    source_seq/tx_seq protocol split that would be required to actually
    distinguish these causes -- not implemented as of V0.7.

    ``source_fps_estimate`` and ``sampling_stride_avg`` exist so that the
    sender behavior described above no longer has to be inferred by hand.
    Both are derived from ``source_seq`` (the DAT/capture frame index,
    which falls back to ``seq`` for every sender that exists today):
    ``sampling_stride_avg`` is how many capture frames pass per frame the
    Tower actually receives (~30 for the current sender, 1.0 for a sender
    forwarding everything), and ``source_fps_estimate`` is the upstream
    capture rate that stride is sampling. Added 2026-08-21 after the first
    physical-glasses remote run required hand arithmetic over log lines to
    establish that its 0.8 received fps was a ~24 fps capture stream
    decimated 1-in-30, rather than transit loss. They are estimates
    labeled as such: they assume ``source_seq`` advances monotonically,
    once per captured frame, at a roughly steady rate, and they say
    nothing about *why* frames were not forwarded -- only how many were
    skipped. Both are computed from the first and last capture index
    observed, so a mid-window sender restart that resets the index
    understates them; a restart that resets it below the first index
    observed makes them unavailable rather than negative.

    Two further limits on ``sampling_stride_avg``, both deliberate:

    * Its denominator is frames actually RECORDED, so intermittent
      Tower-side rejection inflates it. A sender forwarding every capture
      frame, with every other frame answered ``invalid_frame``, reports a
      stride of ~2.0 -- a Tower-side loss misattributed to the sender.
      This is not fixable from inside the metric (rejected frames have no
      trustworthy capture index), so ``frames_rejected`` is reported
      alongside to make the condition visible. **Read the stride as
      trustworthy only when ``frames_rejected`` is 0.**
    * ``source_fps_estimate`` spans the first-to-last RECEIVED FRAME
      (reported as ``source_frame_span_s``), whereas ``effective_fps``
      spans the whole ``stream_start``-bounded window
      (``session_duration_s``). They are not two views of one interval: a
      burst of frames followed by a long silence gives a high
      ``source_fps_estimate`` and a low ``effective_fps`` with no
      contradiction between them.

    ``backpressure_drops`` is tracked separately from ``seq_gap_total`` on
    purpose (2026-08-19 V0.7 planning decision) -- the two have different
    causes (network/link loss or sender sampling vs. a Tower-side drop
    policy) and must never be combined into one number. As of V0.7, no
    code path increments ``backpressure_drops``: the receive -> process ->
    ack loop in tower/routes/ws.py is intentionally left unchanged this
    milestone, so this field will always read 0 until a future milestone
    adds a real drop mechanism.
