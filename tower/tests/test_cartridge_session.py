"""Start, Pause, Stop for a cartridge that produces out of process.

The state machine exists because of a gap measured on real hardware. On
2026-08-26 a Ray-Ban walk produced 2,203 frames and 64 remembered
observations, and every one of those observations existed because a
human opened a second terminal, listed `data/captures` by modification
time, copied a hex id, and ran a producer script against it. There was
no Start. There was no Pause. There was nothing to press.

What a session is NOT:

  * it is not a capture. The capture is minted by the phone's
    `stream_start` and is shared by every cartridge; a session says what
    THIS cartridge does about it.
  * it is not persisted. A Tower that restarts comes back `stopped`,
    because resuming a memory of what a camera sees without anybody
    asking again is the wrong direction to fail in.
  * it is not the producer. It starts and stops one; whether the process
    is alive is the supervisor's answer, and the session reports it
    rather than believing it.
