"""Extending a live solve must equal solving from scratch. Bit for bit.

SYNTHETIC, NOT PHYSICAL. The rooms are rendered by a perfect pinhole; no
number here says anything about the Ray-Ban camera.

`build()` used to re-solve everything on every call, so a walk rebuilt
every k keyframes cost O(N^2/k) and turning live updates UP made the
session slower. `ClassicalTwoViewBackend` was already strictly
forward-only, so the fix was to stop throwing the solve away -- see the
comment on `GeometryBackend.begin`.

That is a refactor whose entire claim is "the answer does not change",
and this file is where that claim is checked. The comparison is EXACT,
with no tolerance at all, and the tolerance is zero for a reason that is
itself tested here: on this OpenCV build the backend is deterministic,
so the same window solved twice is byte-identical (see
`test_the_oracle_is_deterministic_which_is_why_the_tolerance_is_zero`).
Once that holds, any difference between the two paths is state that was
not promoted, and rounding it away with an `allclose` would hide exactly
the bug this file exists to find.

`estimate_window()` is the oracle. It is deliberately NOT implemented in
terms of the incremental path -- the two share the per-pair geometry
helpers, where a copy would certainly drift, and keep their own
orchestration, which is the part being checked.
