"""The Scene Understanding wire path, driven end to end through the real app.

This file exists because of one specific failure mode, and it is the one
an adversarial reviewer of a cartridge should look for first:

    `/cartridges` says the contract is offered, and the production path
    that would serve it does not connect.

Every hop here is production code. The app is `create_app()`. The frames
arrive as base64 JPEG over the real `/ws`, through the real frame handler,
after a real `frame_result`. The session is the one
`tower/cartridge_runtime.py` built. The payload is assembled by the real
adapter and delivered by the real hub through the real subscription.

**The one thing that is stubbed is the detector**, and only the detector:
`_scene_session` is replaced with one whose engine factory returns a stub.
Loading `ssdlite320` would download 13.4 MB of weights on a first run and
add 30 ms per frame to a suite that runs on every commit, and it would
test torchvision rather than this wire. What is under test is that a frame
entering `/ws` comes back out as counts on a subscription -- and every
line responsible for that is real.

`tests/test_object_detection_integration.py` is where the real weights are
exercised, opt-in behind `TOWER_RUN_MODEL_TESTS`.

        THE CEILING IS 12 KB, NOT WORLD BUILDER'S 8, AND THE DIFFERENCE
        IS DELIBERATE. That number is a bandwidth judgement, not a
        protocol limit: the concern is starving the frame path, which

        notes that keep a null from being read as a zero. Re-sent on the
        2 s heartbeat that is 4.6 KB/s per subscriber, against frames at
        12 fps and ~30 KB each: 1.3%.

        The prose was already cut once. `refused_relations` used to carry
        the full research abstracts from `tower/scene/state.py` -- 1,500
        characters for `in_front_of` alone -- and now carries the first
        sentence and a pointer, which took 1.5 KB off every heartbeat. It
        will not be cut further by deleting disclosure: an undercount
        published without its limitations is the failure this cartridge
        exists to avoid, and it is cheaper to send than to explain.

        The assertion below the ceiling is the one that matters more. It
        pins the property rather than the number: saturating the room
        must add only the fixed-arity delta, so the payload cannot grow
