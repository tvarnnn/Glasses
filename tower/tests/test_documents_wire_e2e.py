"""The Document Memory wire path, driven through the real app.

Two halves, and they fail differently, so both are here:

**The library, over HTTP.** A real `DocumentStore` written by the real
engine from rendered pages, read back through the real routes. The one
assertion that matters most is not about a document at all -- it is that
an EMPTY memory answers `no_observation` and not `not_found`. On this
platform that is not an edge case: the page detector fires on essentially
nothing at the geometry the glasses deliver, so `no_observation` is the
answer a real wearer gets today, and a client that rendered it as
"nothing matched" would be reporting a gap in what the camera saw as a
statement about the world.

**The capture session.** Frames over the real `/ws`, through the real
frame handler, into the session `tower/cartridge_runtime.py` built. The
recogniser is stubbed -- `FixedTextRecogniser`, exactly as every other
Document Memory test stubs it -- because EasyOCR costs 5.1 s to construct
and 1.19 s a page, and what is under test is the wiring rather than the
recognition. Recognition accuracy is measured against the real engine in
`tests/test_document_ocr_integration.py`, opt-in behind
`TOWER_RUN_MODEL_TESTS`.
