"""The calibration must reach the builder the Tower starts BY ITSELF.

On 2026-08-25 a 360x640 calibration was measured from real DAT frames,
filed at `<world_root>/intrinsics/360x640.json`, and confirmed by a
direct `IntrinsicsStore.lookup(360, 640)` -- which returned it. The Tower
was then started with that world root and autobuild on, a phone streamed
360x640, and the world came back:

    intrinsics_source  unknown
    backend            unposed  (downgraded_from classical)
    degeneracy         {'no_intrinsics': 69}

Nothing was wrong with the calibration, the path, the store or the
resolution. What was wrong was WHEN the builder asked.

`CaptureWorkerSupervisor` starts the worker from `_start_capture`, at the
instant the capture id is minted -- which is `stream_start`, before the
phone has sent a single frame. The driver then resolved intrinsics
immediately, from a `frames.jsonl` that did not yet have a line in it,
got "resolution not observed", and froze `unknown()` into the session
record. The 360x640 frames arrived ~0.85s later and nothing looked again.

That gap is not a flaky race. Importing the engine, OpenCV included,
takes ~135ms on the Tower host; the first frame landed about a second
after `stream_start`. The worker wins every time.

Every test here therefore attaches the builder to an EMPTY capture and
only then writes frames. A test that writes frames first passes against
the bug -- which is exactly what the existing end-to-end test did.

SYNTHETIC, NOT PHYSICAL: the walk is rendered. The CALIBRATION is the
real measured one, because which record reached the builder is the whole
question here.
