"""Object Memory's first wire path: a read-only HTTP view of observations.

Two things are under test here that are not ordinary transport concerns.

RETENTION CANNOT BE WIDENED. The store clamps every read to
min(persisted, requested), and a review of this cartridge already found
exactly that hole once at the CLI layer -- `--retention-days 3650` served
expired records. A new layer is a new chance to reintroduce it, so the
widening attempt is made HERE, over the route, against a store holding a
record that is genuinely out of window.

THE PAYLOAD MUST NOT OVERCLAIM. `spatial_ref` is None on every record and
nothing in this cartridge knows where anything is in a room. The tests
below pin the field names, because field names are what a client codes
against -- a disclaimer in a doc is not a constraint on a decoder.
