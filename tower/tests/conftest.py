# imports conftest.py before any test module, but an ambient
# TOWER_CV_EXPERIMENT=depth in the operator's shell (e.g. left over from
# manually testing the depth experiment per the README) would otherwise
# still be set when tower.main is first imported during test collection.
# tower/main.py's last line is a module-level `app = create_app()` that
# runs at import time -- before any fixture, even an autouse one, gets a
# chance to run, since fixtures only wrap test *execution*, not import.
# Left uncleared, that import-time create_app() would build a real
# DepthEstimationModule and attempt a real torch import / MiDaS network
# fetch during collection, regardless of which tests are selected.

    """No test reads the object memory of whoever owns this checkout.

    `config.DEFAULT_OBSERVATION_ROOT` is `TOWER_ROOT / "data" /
    "object_memory"`, resolved from `config.py`'s own file location, and
    that is CORRECT FOR THE PRODUCT. It is the default that was
    deliberately reversed on 2026-08-26, after a real walk wrote 64
    observations that every HTTP request answered 404 about: "a default
    that hides data from its owner while still storing it protects
    nobody." Nothing here undoes that. An unconfigured Tower still
    serves; this only changes WHICH directory an unconfigured Tower
    under test serves out of.

    Because for a TEST the same default means something else entirely.
    A test that unsets TOWER_OBSERVATION_ROOT does not get a Tower that
    has observed nothing -- it gets the developer's own accumulated
    store, and asserts against it. That is a privacy defect first (the
    suite reads a real wearer's history off disk) and a flake second.

    It is invisible in CI, which is why it survived: `data/` is
    gitignored, so a fresh clone has an empty default and every
    "observation_count == 0" passes for the wrong reason. On a machine
    that has actually been walked around, the same assertion reads
    `assert 64 == 0` and looks like a mystery.

    A temp directory, not an empty string and not None: "unconfigured"
    must keep meaning "the default root, whatever it is", so the routes
    still answer 200 with an empty listing and the 404 path stays
    reachable only by switching the cartridge off. The directory is not
    created -- a Tower that has never observed anything has no store
    directory either, and the read routes have to cope with that.

    Enforced by two tests in `test_config.py`, which fail if this
    fixture is removed.
