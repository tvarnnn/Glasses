"""Lifecycle races in the shared live-session base, each reproduced first.

These are integration findings 13 and 15, carried open since the
2026-08-27 unification and deferred by the runtime-fitness lane because
fixing them meant touching `stop()`, whose docstring calls its four-step
ordering "the whole correctness of this method" and records what both
previous inversions cost.

The shape they share is the one the unification's final reviewer named:
every falsifiable NUMBER in that lane held, and every claim that failed
was about **lifecycle ownership or session scope** -- written from design
intent rather than read off a running object. So these tests drive two
threads at a real session and read what actually happened.

`_on_pause` is the window in both. It is what `stop()` runs at step 2,
off the lock, and for Document Memory it is `engine.flush()` -- an OCR
pass measured at 1.19 s a page, up to two pages. So this window is
SECONDS wide in the product, not microseconds. Blocking it on an event
here is not an artificial widening; it is the ordinary case held still.

        Found by re-reading the fix rather than by a failing test, which
        is why it is written down rather than only fixed.

        `stop()` waits on the session's completion Event. The worker sets
        that Event in its `finally` and only THEN reacquires its own
        condition to mark itself free. So a `stop()` could return, and
        the next `start()` call `submit()`, while the worker it is about
        to reuse still read as busy. `submit()` refuses, a replacement is
        minted, and the original parks forever -- never reused, never
        exited. One stranded thread per occurrence, which is WORSE than
        the per-session thread this class replaced, because that one at
        least exited.

        Two changes close it: the worker clears `_busy` BEFORE signalling
        the session done, so anything that observes the Event also
        observes the worker free; and a worker that is replaced anyway is
        RETIRED rather than left parked, so the fallback costs at most
        one exiting thread instead of one immortal one.

        HONEST STATUS: THIS TEST PASSED BEFORE THE FIX TOO. 40 rapid
        cycles did not hit the window even once, and it is easy to see
        why -- between `done.set()` and the next `submit()` the stopping
        thread still has to run step 4's teardown and two lock
        acquisitions, which is ample time for the worker to mark itself
        free. So this is a window removed by reading, not a failure
        reproduced. It is closed anyway because the fix is a free
        reordering of two statements, and because "unlikely" stops being
        a defence the moment a loaded host preempts the worker in exactly
        the wrong microsecond -- which is the same argument the module

    session owns nothing until a stream claims it"). Neither re-adopts a
    stream that is STILL OPEN, so after Stop -> Start on the HTTP routes
    the session is owned by nobody.

    This is a privacy defect and not only a resource one. Scene
    Understanding's whole subject is detecting PEOPLE, and "keeps
    observing after the wearer's phone disconnects, and cannot be
    stopped by disconnecting" is a claim about the product, not about
    the process table.

    XFAIL, STRICT, AND DELIBERATELY NOT FIXED HERE.

    The reproduction is kept in the suite rather than in a scratch
    directory because it is real and because the next person to touch
    this should inherit it running, not a paragraph describing it.
    `strict=True` means this turns into a FAILURE the moment somebody
    fixes the defect, which is the prompt to delete the marker.

    It is not fixed here because the mechanical fix is not obviously the
    right one, and this is a hardening lane. `stop()` clearing
    `_stream_owners` is DELIBERATE and is itself a fix: the comment on
    `_stream_owners` records that a surviving flag meant "an operator's
    hand-started session was killed by the next phone that dropped --
    verbatim the failure `stream_closed` claims to prevent". So the two
    defects are opposite ends of one decision:

        adopt too eagerly -> a passing connection stops a session an
                             operator started by hand
        adopt not at all  -> a stream-started session, once restarted
                             over HTTP, can never be stopped by the
                             stream again

    Choosing between them means deciding whether an HTTP `start()` while
    a stream is open should be owned by that stream. That is a product
    decision about iOS-facing lifecycle semantics, it needs the set of
    OPEN streams tracked separately from the set of OWNING ones, and it
    is not a decision an optimization pass gets to make on its own.
