"""Serving the picture behind a record, and refusing to when it cannot.

This is the first surface in this cartridge that serves PIXELS. Until now
it exposed a pointer -- "capture 22e9d428..., frame 3410" -- which is a
correct thing to show a developer and close to useless to a wearer.

Three properties matter more than the rest, and each one has a test that
fails loudly without it:

  1. NO PATH SERVES AN UNFILTERED FRAME. A Tower whose face-detection
     weights are missing refuses. There is no lenient default, because a
     lenient default here means a raw first-person frame on a LAN-local
     origin.
  2. EXPIRED IMAGERY IS A TRUTHFUL ANSWER, not an empty one. Capture-side
     retention is not this cartridge's to set, so a record outliving its
     picture is the ORDINARY case, and "the memory is kept and the
     picture is not" is the sentence it has to be able to produce.
  3. THE LABEL DOES NOT OVERCLAIM. This runs on read; the stored frame is
     unchanged; YuNet has measured blind spots. The payload says
     `display-filter/...` and never "redacted" or "privacy-safe".
