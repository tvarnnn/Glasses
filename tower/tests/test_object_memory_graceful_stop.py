"""Pressing Stop must let the producer finish writing what it saw.

WHAT WAS BROKEN, AND IT WAS THE BUTTON'S WHOLE PURPOSE.

`POST /cartridges/object_memory/session/stop` reaches
`CartridgeSession._detach` -> `CaptureWorkerSupervisor.detach` ->
`Popen.terminate()`. On Windows `terminate()` is `TerminateProcess`:
no unwinding, no `finally`, no `atexit`. The producer's
`finally: engine.release()` -- the only code that closes the sightings
still open, writes the ones that had matured, and refreshes the
duration, `frame_count` and `best_*` of the ones already on disk --
therefore never ran.

The bias is the bad part. The sighting still OPEN when a wearer stops
walking is, by construction, the object they had been looking at
longest. Stop was throwing away the best-observed memories and keeping
the rest.

The fix has three pieces and this file exercises all three:

1. `scripts/object_memory_session.py` installs `_StopRequest`, which
   turns SIGTERM / SIGINT / SIGBREAK into a flag the frame loop reads.
2. `tower/capture_workers._ask_to_stop` asks on two channels BEFORE
   terminating: it closes the child's stdin, and it signals. The stdin
   close is the one that works everywhere -- a console control event
   needs a console, and under a pseudoconsole
   `GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent` reports success and delivers nothing.
   That was measured here, with a trivial child that registered all
   three handlers and was still alive thirty seconds later.
3. `CartridgeSession.DETACH_GRACE_SECONDS` is a real window again,
   because there is finally something for it to wait for.

The subprocess case is the load-bearing one. Piece 1 and piece 2 can
both be asserted with fakes and both be wrong about the platform; only a
real child process proves a request actually crossed one.
