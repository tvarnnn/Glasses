"""Counting must use tracking, and this is where that is proven.

The brief singles this out: *person counting must use tracking rather
than naively summing detections*. Two failure modes make it
non-negotiable, and they pull in opposite directions:

- a detector that misses someone on one frame in five reports a count
  flickering between 2 and 3 while nothing in the room changed;
- a detector that fires twice on one person reports two people.

Every assertion here is against a detection script this file wrote, so
the correct count is known independently of the tracker.
