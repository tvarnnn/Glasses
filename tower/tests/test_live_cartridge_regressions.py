Every test here failed before its fix and passes after. They are together

    `_record` used to stamp `self._capture_id` -- whatever the field held

    reconnect re-arms the recorder) moved the whole reading onto a
    capture it did not come from, and the published `page_source_seqs`
    then resolved into that capture's journal, naming completely
    different frames. A pointer that resolves to the wrong frame is worse
    than no pointer at all.

    The `stream_stop` case was the commoner one: the id was nulled while
    the dwell stayed open, so a document arrived with real frame
    sequence numbers and no recording to resolve them against.

    Freezing the id on the dwell fixed the LABEL and left a subtler
    version of the same lie, which a second review found: the dwell kept
    accepting frames from the new capture, and those frames could win the
    OCR slots. So a document could carry `capture_id: AAAA` and a
    `page_source_seqs` naming frames from BBBB -- and since `source_seq`
    restarts on a reconnect, that pointer resolves to a real but
    different frame in AAAA's journal. Silent, plausible, wrong.
