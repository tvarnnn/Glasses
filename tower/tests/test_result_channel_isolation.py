    means the contract exists and this Tower is not configured to serve
    it -- iOS's "connect". Collapsing them would tell a person to give up
    on a cartridge that one environment variable would turn on.

    it is covered by `tests/test_cv_lab_protocol.py`. The fixture sets a
    world root and nothing else, so the other two are declared and
    UNAVAILABLE, which is the second loop below.

    control surface and a store but is deliberately absent from
    `registry.declare()` until the iOS lane can take the declaration and
