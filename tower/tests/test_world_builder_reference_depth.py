"""Looking further back must add observations and change nothing else.

SYNTHETIC, NOT PHYSICAL. The room is rendered by a perfect pinhole; no
number here says anything about the Ray-Ban camera.

`EXTEND_REFERENCE_DEPTH` widens how far back `_extend` looks for further
sightings of landmarks it already holds. The whole safety case for it is
a separation:

  * it runs AFTER the pose is solved, so it cannot change the pose;
  * its output goes to `support` and NOT to `observed`, so it cannot
    change the next keyframe's pose either.

Both halves are asserted here rather than described, because the first
version of this change did merge into `observed`, and on real footage
that moved poses_solved 22 -> 21 and points 2060 -> 1964 while the
multiplicity metric improved -- a graph statistic rising while the
reconstruction shrank, which is the exact failure this stage was warned
about.

`test_widening_moves_mass_out_of_the_two_view_bucket` is the test that
notices if the mechanism stops running. Set DEPTH to 1 and it fails.
That is deliberate: a mechanism whose removal keeps the suite green is
not tested, and this file exists because that has happened here before.
