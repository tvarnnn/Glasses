"""Two privacy properties that a static test cannot establish.

`test_scene_understanding_persists_nothing` AST-walks the wire path for
calls that could write. That is a strong guard and it is not the same
claim as "a running session wrote nothing": a write could arrive through
a library call the forbidden-name list does not know, or through a
dependency. So this file watches the FILESYSTEM across a real run.

And `keep_page_images` is a constructor argument on Document Memory's
engine. Its default is off and the engine's own docstring says it must
stay off, but a default is a promise about what happens when nobody
chooses. What matters for a web process is whether anything can choose,
and the answer must be no: there is no configuration path that turns it
on, because this platform has no redaction and a stored page image is an
unredacted photograph of what a wearer was reading.
