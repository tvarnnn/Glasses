"""A camera that is not looking at the shared geometry must not vote.

THE DEFECT, stated once so the tests below are readable.

`_pnp_observations` places any target keyframe for which twelve of the
source segment's landmarks survive PnP RANSAC. On repetitive indoor
texture, a keyframe sharing no physical view with the source clears that
bar on aliased matches -- and the fabricated cameras agree with each
other, because they all collapse toward the origin together. A Sim3's
scale IS the ratio of the placed constellation's span to the target's own
span, so a partly collapsed constellation reports a scale that is
confidently, sharply wrong.

Measured with a known answer, by splitting one real segment into halves
that share a frame and a unit by construction (truth: scale exactly 1.0):
segment 29 of the 2026-08-29 drawer walk returned 0.30 -- 3.04x wrong --
at 0.62 deg rotation agreement, 2.48 px reprojection and 2.04 scale
ambiguity. Every clause in `admit()` except reciprocity passed it. Seven
of its eight target cameras were fabricated.

That same signature is what refused pair (14,29) on the real walk -- the
return leg meeting the outbound leg, 20,267 verified inliers between the
two best-conditioned segments in the capture.

These tests are synthetic and arithmetic on purpose. The real-corpus
evidence lives in `tests/test_world_registration.py::TestTheRealWalk`,
which skips on a host without the walk; the mechanism must be pinned
somewhere that never skips.
