"""Start, walk, stop, world -- with nothing typed in a second terminal.

This is the one test that exercises the actual product claim end to end:
a real ASGI app, a real WebSocket, a real `CaptureRecorder`, a real
`world_build_session.py` in a REAL subprocess, a real world on disk, and
the real result channel reporting it.

Everything else in this workstream fakes the spawn, which is right for
testing bookkeeping and wrong for testing that the thing actually runs.
The 2026-08-24 failure was not a bookkeeping error -- every individual
piece worked. What was missing was anybody connecting them.

Slow by nature: a Python subprocess has to start, import OpenCV, tail a
journal and run a build. That cost is the point. A fast version of this
test would be a fake, and a fake is what let the gap exist.
