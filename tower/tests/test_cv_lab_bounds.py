"""What the Lab costs, and the fact that it does not grow.

`handoff.md` 9.3 says a `stream_stop` MAY NEVER ARRIVE, so "for the length
of a run" means "for as long as the Tower is up". Anything that grew per
frame would grow without bound, and this file is the reason to believe
nothing does.

It also pins the arithmetic of the aggregate. A per-frame fraction summed
over 9,199 frames is 768 -- a number that gets printed and believed --
and `MetricKind` exists so the experiment says how its numbers combine.
The tests below check that the Lab ASKS rather than guesses, including for
the metric it has never heard of.
