"""Finding a document again -- and refusing, correctly, when it is not there.

The refusals matter more than the matches. A retrieval layer that guesses
turns "I have no record of reading that" into a confident wrong answer,
which is the failure mode the anti-hallucination requirement exists to
prevent. `07-PLATFORM-CONSTRAINTS.md` Core Principle 3: an observation
gap is never an observation of absence.

Every assertion is against a corpus this file wrote, so which document
contains which term is known independently of the ranking.
