"""A Tower must not offer Scene Understanding it cannot run.

`build_live_cartridges` has always try/excepted `_scene_session`, and
`main.py` has always derived `scene_enabled` from whether that returned a
session -- so the honest mechanism was there. It simply never fired for a
missing torch, because `_resolve_device` imports torch ONLY when the
device is not "cpu", and "cpu" is the default. On a host without the
`[ml]` extra the session constructed happily, `/cartridges` said
`available: true`, and `start()` then failed in 51 ms with a
ModuleNotFoundError. The declaration never self-corrected, because it is
a pure function of configuration.

The fix is an eager `import torch, torchvision` in `_scene_session`, so
the existing mechanism sees what it was always meant to see.

`find_spec` was measured as the alternative and refused: it locates
without executing, so it reported `available: true` for a package whose
loader raises, and answered `POST /scene/start` with 200.

Absence is simulated with a `sys.meta_path` blocker rather than by
uninstalling anything, so these run on a host that HAS torch -- which is
the host this suite normally runs on, and therefore the only way this
would ever be exercised.
