"""Segment placements: registration results, persisted and served.

Registration has existed as an offline script that "reads a world and
writes nothing into it". The served contract carried `registered: false`
and `transform_to_world: null` as literals, so a world with a genuine
registered cluster looked identical on the wire to one with none.

That mattered once the cluster became real: on capture `2e6cffa2`
registration places 3 of 29 segments carrying 1,917 of 4,317 points (44%),
and on `e1c52b9f` 3 of 10 carrying 5,603 of 22,520 (25%). None of it was
visible to anything downstream.

THE CACHE TRAP THIS ALSO CLOSES. `content_hash` deliberately covers only
poses and points, and the geometry-revision rollup is a hash of content
hashes. So a segment that gains a placement without its points changing
keeps its hash, and a client holding a cached chunk would never refetch --
drawing an unplaced version of a segment the world now knows how to place.
`placement_hash` exists so that state is expressible; a client keys its
cache on the pair.
