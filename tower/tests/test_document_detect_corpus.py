"""The glyph gate, judged against REAL frames instead of rendered ones.

PHYSICAL, NOT SYNTHETIC. Every negative in this file is a frame the
glasses actually recorded.

This file exists because the old suite could not have caught the bug it
guards. `test_document_detect.py` and `test_document_memory_hostile.py`
draw their negatives from the same renderer as their positives, so a
threshold tuned on that renderer passed both. The module docstring in
`detect.py` claimed venetian blinds, brick, tiles, stripes and a keyboard
all measured 0 row transitions against a threshold of 8 -- "an order of
magnitude below the text floor". Run over `data/captures/`, a real
venetian blind measures 8.0 and a real backlit keyboard 19-26, and the
detector fired six times in 9,199 frames, every one of them wrong.

The corpus is machine-local (`data/` is gitignored), so these skip where
it is absent. That is a real limit and it is the reason the derivation is
also written down in
`docs/superpowers/research/2026-08-26-document-gate-rederivation.md`.

What is NOT here: a page. No capture in the corpus contains a sheet of
paper, so nothing in this file measures recall or proves the detector
finds documents. It pins the negative side only.
