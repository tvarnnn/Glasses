"""The live preview: bounded, latest-only, and unable to slow a frame down.

Four things this file is here to make true rather than to hope for.

1. **Nothing grows.** One capture and one encoding exist at a time, for
   the length of a run that `handoff.md` 9.3 says may never end. No list,
   no queue, no directory.
2. **A picture from run A never appears under run B's name.** Three
   independent guards -- run identity, an epoch, and age -- and a test
   for each, because the value of three is that no one of them is
   trusted alone.
3. **A broken picture costs a picture.** Not a run, not a module, and
   certainly not `ModuleContainer.mark_failed()`, which is terminal.
4. **A consumer that stops consuming costs nothing that accumulates.**
   The frames it missed were dropped when they were replaced, not queued
   against its return.
