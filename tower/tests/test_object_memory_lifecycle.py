"""Press Start; a producer attaches itself. Press Stop; it lets go.

The product claim of this workstream, asserted against the real ASGI app.

What it replaces was measured, not imagined. On 2026-08-26 a real
Ray-Ban walk went through the phone, the Tower, a capture directory and
an object-memory producer, and produced 64 observations the iOS app
displayed correctly. Every one of those observations required a human to:

  1. start a generic recording from the Home screen,
  2. find the capture directory that had just been minted,
  3. run `object_memory_session.py --follow-capture <dir>` in a second
     terminal,
  4. and then set `TOWER_OBSERVATION_ROOT` to the same directory the
     producer had defaulted to, because until they did, every HTTP
     request answered 404 about the memory that had just been written.

None of those four steps exists any more, and each of the four has a
test below.

The worker itself is faked throughout. A real producer would need a real
capture to tail and 13.4 MB of weights to load; what is under test here
is the WIRING and the STATE MACHINE, which is where every one of the four
steps actually lived.
