"""The tracker defects an adversarial review found, pinned.

Each one produced a *wrong answer*, not a crash — a phantom person
permanently counted, a real person silently replaced by an artifact, one
stranger's orientation reported as another's. Those are the failures that
matter here, because a wrong count looks exactly like a right one.

The review also named why the original suite missed all of them, and the
reason is worth carrying: every existing tracking test used widely
separated, non-competing boxes. Nothing ever gave two tracks a shared
candidate, so nothing exercised association at all.
