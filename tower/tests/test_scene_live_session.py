"""Start, Pause, Stop -- and what each of them must actually do.

The three failure modes a reviewer of a live cartridge should hunt for are
all lifecycle failures, and all three are asserted here:

- Start/Stop that does not control the work. `frames_observed` must stop
  moving after `stop()` and must not move before `start()`.
- Stale state served after Stop. The single most damaging thing this
  cartridge could do is answer "what is around you" about a room the
  wearer left, so `stop()` DISCARDS the last state rather than freezing
  it.
- An unbounded queue. There is one slot; the hundredth frame offered to a
  busy worker must cost the same memory as the second, and the drops must
  be counted where a client can see them.

No torch here. The engine is a stub, because what is under test is the
session around the engine, not the detector -- and a test that had to
load a 13 MB model to prove that `pause()` stops feeding it would not be
run often enough to be worth writing.
