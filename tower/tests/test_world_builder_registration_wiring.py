"""Registration runs when a walk ends, and cannot take the walk down with it.

The defect these cover is not a wrong answer, it is a question never
asked. `scripts/world_registration.py` -- the Sim3 fit, the mutual
evidence rule, the cycle check, the digest-bound persistence, the
serving-side staleness refusal -- was complete, tested and inert. Nothing
called it. Every physical walk therefore finalised with no
`placements.json`, and the phone drew every segment as its own island:
22 disconnected fragments on the 2026-08-29 drawer walk, whose segments
were not refused so much as never considered.

So these tests are about wiring and blast radius, not about geometry.
The geometry is `tests/test_world_registration.py`'s subject and is
unchanged.
