"""Cycle consistency: the first independent check registration can run.

Every gate in `admit()` judges ONE pair using evidence from that pair.
None of them can see an error that only shows up going round a loop --
which is exactly the failure the research note calls the dangerous one,
because a wrong Sim3 fits well and reads as a slightly odd floor plan.

`compose_tree` places segments along a spanning tree and its docstring
says so: "A spanning tree is used rather than a pose graph because on the
real walk the admitted subgraph has no cycle at all... When cycles do
appear, the right next step is cycle-consistency CHECKING, which is free
and independent." `WORLD-BUILDER-STATUS.md` P10 says the same: "This is
the first thing to add when a cycle appears."

A cycle has appeared. After the solve-chain segmentation change, capture
`2e6cffa2` admits (12,16), (12,19) and (16,19) -- a triangle. Measured on
it, composing 12->16->19 against the direct 12->19 disagrees by 6.0% in
scale, 5.899 degrees in rotation, and 5.13 in translation, while every
one of those three edges passed reciprocity on its own.
