"""A solver assertion is a refusal, not a crash.

OpenCV's SQPNP solver raises when the minimal sample RANSAC hands it has
degenerate coordinate variance:

    sqpnp.cpp:236: (-215:Assertion failed)
    point_coordinate_variance >= POINT_VARIANCE_THRESHOLD

Whether it fires depends on which minimal sample RANSAC happens to draw,
so it is data-dependent and cannot be provoked reliably from a fixture.
It was reproduced on a real 33-segment world built from capture
22e9d428, where it killed the registration run outright (exit 1).

Both production call sites are covered here. The engine one matters more:
an uncaught assertion there takes down a live walk mid-room.
