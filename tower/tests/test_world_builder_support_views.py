"""Which 2D feature in which keyframe produced which 3D landmark.

SYNTHETIC, NOT PHYSICAL. The room is rendered by a perfect pinhole; no
number here says anything about the Ray-Ban camera.

The association exists at solve time -- `classical.py`'s `observed` dict
-- and used to die with the stack frame. Cross-segment registration
needs it (docs/superpowers/research/2026-08-26-cross-segment-registration
.md section 1), and re-deriving it costs a full re-solve, so it is
persisted.

Two things this file is really checking.

1. THE ASSOCIATION IS TRUE, not merely present. Every row is verified by
   reprojecting the landmark it names into the frame it names and
   comparing against the feature it names. A table of plausible integers
   that points at the wrong features would pass a shape assertion and
   fabricate a registration later.

2. THE LIVE PATH RECORDS THE WHOLE HISTORY. `_Chain.forget_before` prunes
   `observed` down to one frame deliberately, so a table read off the
   chain at the end would hold one frame's worth on the live path and
   everything on the rebuild path -- different data under one field name.
   `test_a_live_solve_records_the_same_association_as_a_cold_solve` is
   the trap, stated as a test.
