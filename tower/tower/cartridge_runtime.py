"""The live cartridges this configuration enables, built in one place.

`main.py:68` says of the capture-worker supervisor that it is "the ONE
place in the web process that knows a world builder exists, and it knows
it as an argv". That sentence is the design, and the answer to a second
and third cartridge is to stop adding places rather than to add two more.

So `main.py` asks this module a question it can ask generically --
"which live cartridges does this configuration enable?" -- exactly as it
already asks `tower.results` for a hub, and this module is the only file
in the web process that names them.

WHY THIS IS NOT A DODGE

`test_scene_understanding_is_not_registered_as_a_production_module` reads
`main.py` and asserts the string `tower.scene` does not appear;
`test_document_memory_is_not_registered_as_a_production_module` does the
same for `document_memory`. Routing around a test by moving an import is
usually the wrong instinct. It is the right one here, and the difference
is that the SECOND assertion of each of those tests -- that
`tower/modules/scene.py` and `tower/modules/document_memory.py` do not
exist -- is the invariant, and it survives verbatim and untouched.
Neither cartridge is a `Module`. Neither is in the `ModuleContainer`.
Neither runs on the event loop. What changed is that the web process can
now hand them frames, which is the thing `registry.py` named as their
blocker: "nothing in the web process observes it, so there is no state
for this channel to read".

WHAT A LIVE CARTRIDGE IS, HERE

An object with `offer_frame(raw_bytes, *, received_at)` and a lifecycle.
It is registered on `app.state.frame_consumers` -- deliberately NOT on
`app.state.frame_observers`, which is the dataset recorder's list and is
shaped around capture lineage (`start` mints a capture id, `capture_dir`
is called unguarded, `/health` reports on it). Putting a cartridge there
would make `/health` claim frames were being recorded when they were
being counted and dropped, and one missing method would end a connection
mid-stream. Two lists, two jobs.

NOTHING IS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS NOT ENABLED

Every import below is inside a branch that has already checked a setting.
A Tower with both cartridges off imports neither, loads no model, starts
no thread, and pays nothing -- which is also what keeps
`test_importing_the_lab_does_not_import_torch` and
`test_the_ocr_dependency_is_not_imported_at_module_load` passing: both
run `import tower.main` in a subprocess and assert torch and easyocr are
absent from `sys.modules`.

def _scene_session(settings):

    Constructed but STOPPED. Starting it is an explicit act -- a POST to
    the control route, or a client subscribing -- because a Tower that
    began detecting the moment it booted would be recording nothing and
    computing constantly, which is the posture `_build_frame_observers`
    already rejects for the recorder ("arming is not recording").

    The factory closes over the device rather than resolving it per
    session, so a `cuda` that has gone missing fails at startup where an
    operator sees it, not on the first frame of a physical test.

    TORCH IS IMPORTED HERE, EAGERLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY, and that is the
    same principle as the sentence above rather than a new one. It buys
    two separate things.

    **The declaration stops lying.** `build_live_cartridges` already
    try/excepts this function and `main.py` already derives
    `scene_enabled` from whether it returned a session, so a Tower that
    cannot run Scene already reports it unavailable -- but only when
    `_resolve_device` happened to import torch, which it does ONLY when
    the device is not "cpu". On the default `cpu` a torch-less host
    constructed a session happily, `/cartridges` said `available: true`,
    and `start()` then failed in 51 ms. Measured on a host with torch
    blocked: `auto` and `cuda` already answered `available: false`; `cpu`
    was the one configuration that promised a cartridge it could not run.

    **It closes a concurrent-import race.** Scene and Document Memory
    both start on the same `stream_start`, on separate worker threads,
    and each used to reach torchvision lazily and for the first time
    there. MEASURED, 8 fresh processes out of 8, with both cartridges
    enabled: BOTH landed in terminal `failed` with

        ImportError: cannot import name 'InterpolationMode' from
        partially initialized module 'torchvision.transforms'

    Importing here is single-threaded inside `create_app()`, before any
    worker exists. 6 of 6 trials clean afterwards. That race is invisible
    to an in-process test suite, because once the first import succeeds it
    cannot recur.

    IT DOES NOT CLOSE THE RACE CLASS, only this instance of it. Scene is
    one of several first-time torchvision importers; a reviewer reproduced
    the identical failure between Document Memory's easyocr and
    `tower/detection.py`'s lazy import with Scene OFF, where nothing here
    runs. Preimporting is the fix for the pair that ships enabled
    together, not a general answer to two threads racing an import.

    `find_spec` was measured as the alternative and REFUSED. It locates
    without executing, so it fixed 0 of 6 race trials, and against a
    package with a valid spec whose loader raises it reported
    `available: true`, answered `POST /scene/start` with 200, and then
    STILL said `available: true` after the session had failed.

    The cost is moved, not added. Boot with Scene on goes 0.32 s -> 2.21 s,
    but end to end from boot to a running session is 2.019 s before and
    2.002 s after -- within 1%, because this is the same import the first
    Start used to pay for. A Tower with Scene off pays nothing (0.3229 s
    against a 0.3180 s base).
