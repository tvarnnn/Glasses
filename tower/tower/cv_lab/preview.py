"""One derived picture at a time, and no way for it to slow a frame down.

What this is for
----------------
The Lab was, until this module, a screen of numbers. `edge_density:
0.071` is a true statement about a frame and it is almost useless to the
person wearing the glasses, who wants to know whether the algorithm can
see the doorway. This turns the array the experiment already computed
into something a person can look at.

The one rule
------------
**Visualisation may never make the CV path slower.** Everything below is
shaped by that and by nothing else.

    frame  ->  experiment.run()          the authoritative work
           ->  LivePreview.capture()     two attribute assignments and
                                          a clock comparison
           ->  ...
           ->  GET /cv-lab/preview       resize, colourise, encode --
                                          on a worker thread, and only
                                          when somebody actually asked

The frame path does no image work at all. `capture()` takes the array the
experiment computed -- by reference, no copy, no resize, no encode -- and
puts it in a slot. Everything expensive happens later, in `render()`,
which Starlette runs in its thread pool because the route that calls it
is a plain `def`. That is the same reason every disk-touching route in
this Tower is a `def`, and it is the whole answer to "can the viewer
backpressure the pipeline": the event loop never runs the encoder.

If nobody ever fetches, nothing is ever encoded. The work is not queued
for later -- it simply does not happen.

Bounded by shape
----------------
There is ONE slot and ONE cached encoding. `capture()` overwrites;
`render()` replaces. There is no list, no deque, no `maxlen` to get
wrong, and no file. A consumer that stops consuming costs nothing that
grows: it costs the same one array and the same one buffer it cost while
it was keeping up, and the frames it missed were dropped at the moment
they were replaced rather than accumulated against its return.

That matters more here than it sounds. `handoff.md` 9.3 says a
`stream_stop` MAY NEVER ARRIVE, so "for the length of a run" means "for
as long as the Tower is up". Anything per-frame would be unbounded.

Staleness is answered three ways, on purpose
--------------------------------------------
1. **Run identity.** Every capture carries the `run_id` it was produced
   under. A caller may name the run it is watching, and a preview from
   another run is refused rather than served -- the "stop A, start B, A's
   last frame arrives" case, closed at the Tower rather than trusted to
   the phone.
2. **An epoch.** Every stop, pause and release bumps a counter. A render
   that began before one and finished after it is discarded, because the
   bytes it holds are of a run that is no longer live.
3. **Age.** A capture older than `PREVIEW_MAX_AGE_S` is refused. A phone
   showing a four-second-old edge map while its wearer turns their head
   is showing a lie about where they are looking, and "the picture
   stopped" is a much better thing for a person to see than "the picture
   is wrong".

Failure is contained
--------------------
`render()` never raises. An encoder that fails produces a refusal with a
reason, the counters record it, and the experiment neither knows nor
cares -- it has already returned its result and its numbers are already
on the wire. A preview is a convenience, and no convenience gets to end
a run.

Threads
-------
`begin`, `suspend`, `end` and `capture` run on the event loop, from the
Lab. `render`, `descriptor` and `stats` run on worker threads. The
handover is a single attribute assignment of an immutable object, which
is atomic in CPython and needs no lock -- the same technique
`CVLab._last_frame_provenance` already uses, for the same reason.
`_stats_guard` covers only the counters the serving side writes and the
status document reads; the frame path never touches it, because a lock
on the measured path to make a diagnostic one frame fresher is paying in
the wrong currency.

    flicker mechanism, because one pixel of specular glare moving through
    the frame rescales the whole picture's brightness and a wall appears
    to pulse while the wearer stands still.

    Two cheap changes fix it and neither needs a second model:

    1. **Percentiles, not extremes.** The 2nd and 98th percentiles of the
       frame instead of its min and max, so a handful of outlier pixels
       cannot set the scale for the other fifty thousand.
    2. **Smoothed bounds.** Those percentiles are folded into an
       exponential moving average with `alpha = 0.2` -- about a
       five-frame time constant -- so the SCALE moves slowly while the
       picture moves at full rate. The smoothing is on the two bounds and
       never on the pixels: smoothing pixels would ghost, and a depth map
       that ghosts is worse than one that flickers.

    Anything outside the smoothed bounds is clipped rather than allowed
    to widen them, which is what makes a hand entering frame brighten
