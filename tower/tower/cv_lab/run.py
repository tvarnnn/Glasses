"""One CV Lab run: its identity, its counters, and its measurements.

A run is the unit of provenance. Everything the Lab publishes -- every
`frame_result`, every aggregate metric, every timing -- names the run that
produced it, and a run names exactly one experiment. That is the whole
mechanism by which a result from a previous experiment cannot be read as a
result from the current one: there is no shared accumulator to leak
through, because a new experiment is a new run object.

**Constant memory, by construction.** Every accumulator here is O(1) in
frames: a mean is a running total and a count, a maximum is a maximum. A
run has no frame list, no metric history and no sample buffer. This is not
frugality -- `handoff.md` 9.3 says a `stream_stop` MAY NEVER ARRIVE, so
"for the length of a run" means "for as long as the Tower is up", and
anything that grew per frame would grow without bound.

**Aggregation is the experiment's decision, not this module's.** A
per-frame `tracked_fraction` summed over 9,199 frames is 768, which is the
kind of number that gets printed and believed. `MetricKind` exists so the
producer says how its numbers combine, and this file asks rather than
guesses -- including for the metric it has never heard of, which is
reported as unclassified rather than folded in under a default.
