"""The CV Lab itself: one slot, many experiments, one truthful document.

What this replaces
------------------
Choosing an experiment used to mean editing `TOWER_CV_EXPERIMENT`,
restarting the Tower, starting a generic recording somewhere else, and
reading an anonymous number off a debug panel. Every part of that is a
consequence of one fact: the experiment was decided at process start and
nothing on the wire could say which one it was. This module moves the
decision to runtime and puts a name on every number that leaves.

What it is NOT
--------------
It is not a module registry and it does not swap modules.
`ModuleContainer` still holds exactly one `Module`, constructed once, with
no discovery and no swap path -- `04-MODULE-SYSTEM.md` forbids dynamic
discovery before V1.0 and nothing here works around that. What changed is
what is *inside* the one Lab slot, which is what the module's own
docstring has said all along: "one Lab slot, many experiments".

Three clocks' worth of care, in one place
-----------------------------------------
1. **The frame path is synchronous and on the event loop.** `process()`
   never awaits, so no command can interleave *within* a frame. That is
   what makes `frame_provenance()` -- read by `ws.py` immediately after
   `process()`, with no await between -- describe the frame it just
   answered rather than some later one.

2. **A load is not.** A model-backed experiment's `load()` downloads
   weights and blocks; `depth` fetches 119 MB the first time. Awaiting
   that inside a connection's receive loop would stop that socket reading
   for minutes, and `handoff.md` 13.7 says iOS replaces a connection it
   cannot write to for two seconds. So `start()` validates, publishes
   `starting`, and hands the load to a background task. The command
   returns immediately; the outcome arrives as state, which is exactly
   the shape iOS's `run(_:)` already has.

3. **The status document is read from another thread.** The result
   channel's poller computes snapshots with `asyncio.to_thread`, so
   `status()` runs concurrently with the loop that mutates this object.
   Every state transition and every status build therefore happens under
   `_guard`. The FRAME PATH deliberately does not take it: it mutates
   only per-run counters, whose individual reads are atomic, and putting
   a lock on the measured path to make a diagnostic one frame fresher
   would be paying in the wrong currency.

Staleness is structural, not checked
------------------------------------
A run is the unit of provenance and a new experiment is a new run. The
old experiment is released BEFORE the new run id is published, so there
is no window in which a result produced by one experiment can carry
another's name. `run_id` travels on every `frame_result` and on the
status document, and a client that sees a result whose `run_id` is not
the one it is watching should discard it -- not because the Tower is
expected to send one, but because that is the only way a reconnect across
a restart cannot show a previous Tower's numbers.

        `count` is `null` when the experiment does not produce one and a
        NUMBER when it does, including zero. `0` is a real result meaning
        "found nothing" and must not merge with "did not say".

        `artifact` is no longer always `null`, and the sentence that used
        to be here is worth keeping in view because it is the standard
        this had to meet. It said: `IOS-to-Tower.md` 5 withholds any
        image whose treatment is unstated, and artifact fetching itself
        is UNKNOWN -- iOS "holds no URL, no id format, and no bytes,
        because inventing a fetch scheme would be exactly the fabricated
        contract this work refuses to produce", so "serving an inline
        image here would be the Tower inventing that scheme
        unilaterally". It ended: "The field exists so that a later
        contract adds a payload where a `null` is, rather than adding a
        field."

        This is that contract, and it is the payload going where the
        `null` was. What makes it not the fabrication that sentence
        refused:

        - it landed on BOTH sides in one change, with
          `docs/contracts/EXPERIMENTAL-CV-PREVIEW.md` written down,
          rather than one side guessing what the other would accept;
        - the treatment is STATED, in iOS's own vocabulary, and it is
          the strict value: `raw_ephemeral`, live view only, never
          persisted and never re-served;
        - no image goes INLINE. What is here is a path, a media type and
          a treatment -- the bytes are a separate fetch a client makes
          only if it wants one, which is what `IOS-to-Tower.md`'s own
          `notFetched`/`fetching`/`available` state machine was written
          around;
        - it is `null` again, with a reason, the moment there is nothing
          honest to put here -- previews off, or an experiment with
          nothing to draw.
