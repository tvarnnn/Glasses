"""What Scene Understanding knows, and the words it is allowed to use.

Two constraints shape every name here.

**This is a live state, not a memory.** Nothing in this module is
persisted, so there is no schema version, no `time_basis` on a stored
record, and no retention policy -- because there is nothing stored to
version, stamp or expire. A cartridge answering "what is around me now"
has no reason to write to disk, and Environmental Memory is where a
durable record would belong.

**Nothing here is identity.** A `track_id` means "the same blob I
associated across adjacent frames", not "the same person as yesterday".
It is an integer, session-scoped, and meaningless once the process ends.

And nothing here is gaze. `07-PLATFORM-CONSTRAINTS.md` Limitation 8: the
camera cannot establish that anyone looked at anything. The field is
`appears_facing_wearer`, and it stays that even when it is inconvenient.
