"""Run worker processes for the lifetime of a capture, and reap them.

This is the piece whose absence made the first physical World Builder
test (2026-08-24) require a second terminal, a directory listing, and a
copied UUID. The Tower recorded ten captures that evening and a human
attached a follower to one of them by hand. The other nine were never
read by anything, so the wearer walked for five minutes with the camera
reporting LIVE and the world frozen at the figures from the first two.

It happened a second time, to a different cartridge, on 2026-08-26: a
real Ray-Ban walk produced 2,203 frames and 64 remembered observations,
and every one of them existed because a human found the capture
directory and started a producer against it in another terminal. The
supervisor could not have done it, because it ran exactly ONE spec and
that slot was taken.

**One spec was never the design; it was the number of specs that
existed.** A supervisor is now given a LIST, each entry named, each
optionally GATED by a predicate the wiring point supplies. The list is
still argv and strings.

**This module is deliberately cartridge-blind.** It knows how to run an
argv when a capture opens, how to stop one on request, and how to reap.
It does not know what any worker computes, and it names no cartridge --
which is what lets `test_the_capture_worker_supervisor_is_cartridge_blind`
stay green without an exemption. The argv and the gate both come from
`main.py`, the wiring point, as plain strings and a plain callable.

**The web process still does not build, and does not remember.** It
supervises children that do. That separation is the reason a rebuild can
take seconds without the frame path noticing, and it is the architecture
decision `docs/agent-handoffs/WORLD-BUILDER.md` section 1 exists to
protect.

def _ask_to_stop(process) -> bool:
    """Ask a worker to stop, without killing it. Returns whether it was asked.

    THE GRACE WINDOW WAS WAITING ON A REQUEST NOBODY HAD MADE.

    `_stop_worker` used to `wait(grace)` first and terminate second. That
    is the right shape, but nothing in between ever told the worker
    anything, so the wait measured the full grace every single time and
    the process was shot at the end of it regardless. The Object Memory
    producer's `finally: engine.release()` -- the only code that closes
    open sightings and writes the ones that matured -- therefore never
    ran when a wearer pressed Stop. The fix is not a longer wait. It is
    to ask.

    TWO CHANNELS, BECAUSE ONE OF THEM DOES NOT WORK WHERE THIS RUNS.

    The obvious channel is a signal, and on POSIX `terminate()` is
    `SIGTERM` and that is the whole story. On Windows `terminate()` is
    `TerminateProcess`, which is not a signal and cannot be caught, so
    the only route to a catchable stop is a console control event --
    which is why `_start` passes `CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`, and
    `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` rather than `CTRL_C_EVENT` because a new process
    group starts with Ctrl-C disabled.

    A SIGNAL IS NOT ENOUGH, AND THE REASON IS NOT THE ONE FIRST WRITTEN
    HERE.

    This docstring used to claim that a console control event is never
    delivered under a pseudoconsole and that the child hears nothing. **A
    reviewer measured the opposite and was right.** Under
    `GetConsoleWindow() == 0` the event IS delivered, and a child that
    installed no handler dies of it with `STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT` and no
    unwinding at all -- which is the more dangerous half of the truth,
    because it means a signal sent to the wrong worker destroys exactly
    the grace it was meant to protect. That is what
    `_Worker.handles_stop_request` gates, and it is why the gate is not
    optional.

    The stdin channel stays, and is still the first one tried, for
    reasons that survive the correction: a pipe needs no console at all,
    so it works where an event genuinely cannot be delivered (a detached
    service, a job object, a host that revoked the group); it is
    unambiguous, where a control event's disposition depends on what the
    child did with its handlers; and closing it costs nothing when the
    child is already gone. Two independent channels for a request that
    must not be missed is the shape, and neither is required to succeed.

    So the FIRST channel is closing the child's stdin. The supervisor
    holds the write end for any spec that asked for it
    (`WorkerSpec.stop_via_stdin`), closing it is an EOF the child's
    reader thread cannot miss, and a pipe needs no console, no signal
    disposition and no permission. It also fixes something adjacent for
    free: a producer orphaned by a Tower that died gets its EOF from the
    operating system rather than polling for its full fifteen-minute idle
    bound.

    Both are attempted. Neither is required to succeed, and each is
    contained separately -- a signal that raises must not stop the pipe
    from being closed. Contained overall as "not asked" so the caller
    falls through to `terminate()` rather than leaving a worker alive
    because an optional courtesy failed.

    The lineage distinction is the older half of the design.
    `CaptureFollower` already follows a capture across a reconnect:
    seeing a capture close by disconnect it waits out
    `RESUME_GRACE_SECONDS` for a successor whose manifest names it, and
    continues into that one. So a successor capture already has a reader.
    Starting a second worker for it would put two followers, two mapping
    sessions and two writer locks on one walk -- and the result channel,
    which prefers "a LIVE world if one exists", would then have two live
    worlds to choose between and would pick by `updated_at`.

    Lineage is decided by the WRITER and written into the manifest

    `continues` value it is handed; it never guesses which capture
    continues which.

    pressed as a capture opened ran the "is anything already following
    this lineage" check twice, both times seeing nothing, and spawned two
    producers on one capture. The second overwrote the first in the
    registry, so the orphan was invisible to `reap`, `detach`,
    `shutdown` and `/health` -- and two producers appending to one JSONL
