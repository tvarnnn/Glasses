"""Start, Pause and Stop for a cartridge that produces out of process.

**Why this is shared code rather than one cartridge's.** Every producer
in this repository runs in its own process and tails a capture journal --
World Builder, Scene, Document Memory and Object Memory all do. None of
them had a way for a wearer to say "start remembering" or "stop", because
the only thing that ever started a producer was a human typing a command.
The first cartridge to need the button would have built it privately, and
the second would have built it again slightly differently. So the state
machine lives here, knows no cartridge, and is handed a worker NAME.

**What a session is not.**

  * Not a capture. The capture id is minted by the phone's
    `stream_start` and is shared by everything watching the camera; a
    session says what one cartridge DOES about it.
  * Not persisted. A Tower that restarts comes back `stopped`. Resuming
    a memory of what a camera sees, without anybody asking again, is the
    wrong direction to fail in -- and the alternative, a state file,
    would be a promise this process could not keep across a crash.
  * Not the producer. It starts and stops one. Whether a process is
    actually alive is the supervisor's answer, and `snapshot()` reports
    that separately from the state, because "the wearer asked for this"
    and "it is happening" are different claims and the gap between them
    is exactly the failure worth showing.

**Three states, and the reason there is no fourth.** `stopped`, `active`,
`paused`. There is no `starting`: attaching is a `Popen` and a dict
update, and a transient state that no client can ever observe is a state
that only exists to be got wrong.

**SERIALISED, because the transport is concurrent.** The routes are sync
`def` so a five-second detach stays off the event loop, which means
FastAPI runs them in its threadpool and two actions can be in flight at
once. Unserialised, a Stop arriving while a Start was between "set
ACTIVE" and "attach" left the session `stopped` with a producer running
-- and `stop()` from `stopped` returned early without detaching, so a
second Stop could not recover it. The one control a wearer has over being
remembered failed OPEN. A reviewer reproduced it: `state=stopped`,
`following=['cap-1']`, live pid.

Every action holds the lock for its whole duration, including the
attach and the detach. That makes a Pause take as long as stopping a
process takes and makes a concurrent Start wait for it, which is correct:
these are a person pressing buttons, not a hot path.

# The five seconds before that were worse than useless: nothing SIGNALLED
# the producer -- it is a follower tailing a journal that is still being

# measured 5.01 seconds every single time before the process was
# terminated anyway. The grace bought nothing and cost a wearer five
# seconds of a control whose whole purpose is to stop recording NOW.
#
# What changed is the producer. `scripts/object_memory_session.py` now
# installs `_StopRequest`, `CaptureWorkerSupervisor._ask_to_stop` sends
# the signal that sets it (a `CTRL_BREAK_EVENT` to the process group on
# Windows, where `terminate()` is `TerminateProcess` and cannot be
# caught), and the frame loop ends at the next frame so its
# `finally: engine.release()` runs. That call is the ONLY thing that
# closes the sightings still open at the instant of a Stop -- and the
# sighting still open when a wearer stops walking is, by construction,
# the object they were looking at most. Zero seconds threw those away.
#
# THREE, and not more, because this blocks an HTTP handler.
#
# The measured flush is a `wait_idle()` on the verification queue plus a
# `_settle()` per open sighting; the queue is bounded at 8 pending and a
# verdict measured 126 ms on the GPU, so the worst case is well inside
# this. The route is a sync `def` and the iOS client's timeout is ten
# seconds, so three leaves both room. A producer that overruns is still
# terminated, and the log says so and says what was lost.

        SEPARATE FROM `_following` ON PURPOSE, and a reviewer found the
        defect that made it necessary.

        `_following` WIDENS on a `TypeError`: it retries without `since`,
        because a supervisor from before that keyword existed should
        still be able to answer the public `following` field, and
        over-reporting what is running is the safe direction there.

        It is the unsafe direction here. Handing that widened list back
        as `following_this_session` tells a client "these are the
        producers YOU started" when the answer is "every producer on this
        Tower" -- which is exactly the false positive this field was
        added to remove, and it would raise the loud "something you did
        not start is recording, and Stop will not reach it" warning about
        a recording the person started themselves. `_supervisor_mark`
        already refuses to guess for that reason; this refuses for it
        too.

        The `TypeError` catch is narrow and deliberate. One raised INSIDE
        a modern `following()` is a bug in the supervisor rather than an
        old signature, and swallowing it as "cannot scope" would hide it
        -- so it is logged at exception level in the general branch below
        rather than folded into the quiet one.

        THREE ANSWERS, NOT TWO, AND THE THIRD IS WHY THIS IS NOT A LIST.

        - a **list** -- these captures, and no others, have a producer
          this session started still alive on them;
        - the **empty list** -- this session has started nothing that is
          still running. A positive claim;
        - **None** -- this session cannot scope the question at all,
          because the supervisor has no clock mark to offer or cannot
          answer a scoped question. See `_scoped_following`.

        The third is not pedantry. A client draws "you are being
        recorded" from this field and draws a loud "a producer you did
        NOT start is recording, and Stop will not reach it" from the
        difference between it and `following`. Answering "I cannot tell"
        with the empty list turns every producer into somebody else's,
        including this session's own, and prints an alarm about a
        recording the person started themselves. A reviewer found exactly
        that, and the fix is to say null and let the client fall back to
        `following`.

        Not gated on the state. An earlier draft returned the empty list
        whenever the session was `stopped`, and that was wrong in the one
        direction that matters: a producer a Stop failed to kill is still
        this session's and is still recording. The honest answer to "what
        did I start that is running" is its capture, not nothing. The
        same holds for `paused`.
