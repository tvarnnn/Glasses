"""Frames in, observed documents out.

The whole shape of this file follows from one measurement: OCR costs
~1.2 s per page. That is roughly 400x the per-frame detection cost, so
the pipeline is built to make the expensive stage rare rather than fast.

    every frame     decode, detect a page, update dwell     ~3 ms
    per dwell       pick the best one or two frames         free
    per dwell       warp and OCR those                      ~1.2 s each

Nothing here runs on the Tower event loop. Like World Builder, this is an
engine plus an offline/live driver, because the module contract is a
registry of one with a scalar-shaped result and 1.2 s of OCR could not
sit on the frame path regardless.
