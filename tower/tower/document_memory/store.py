Append-only JSONL plus atomic whole-file rewrite for prune and purge --

the third consumer is where a pattern stops being a coincidence.

Rewrites operate on **raw dicts**, not on parsed records. Round-tripping

        FILTERING IS THE DEFAULT, and it was not always.

        Until 2026-08-27 this method ignored `retention_seconds`
        entirely: the window was consumed only by `prune_expired` and
        `purge`, both deletion paths. So a reader that constructed a
        store with an 86-second window was served a 400-day-old document
        in full -- while the response it fed asserted, in three separate
        strings, that the window had been applied.

        reports success is what `06-PRIVACY-DATA.md` calls a false
        assurance, and it is why iOS ships no privacy toggle backed by a
        Tower it cannot verify.

        It is also a bug this repository had already fixed one cartridge
        over. `tower/object_memory/store.py:44` records the identical
        defect and the identical fix; `_is_within_retention` above is
        that method, and it is a static method for the same reason:
        reads and prune must use one definition of "expired" or the two
        drift.

        `include_expired` is the opt-out and must be asked for by name.
        It exists for maintenance paths -- a purge counting what it
        deletes, an operator auditing the file -- and is never the right
