"""The Experimental CV Lab's own types: a result, a protocol, a registry.

Two shapes matter here.

`ExperimentResult` carries a MANDATORY headline (`result_value` +
`result_label`) and an OPTIONAL bag of `metrics`. The headline is a
discipline, not a limitation: an experiment that cannot name its single
most important number has not decided what it is measuring. The bag is
what makes the Lab useful at all -- frame quality has six things to say,
optical flow four, detection a count and a distribution, and a single
scalar threw all of that away.

`Experiment` is a protocol with `load`/`run`/`release` rather than a bare
callable. Before this, a stateful experiment cost a whole `Module`
subclass -- there were two of them sharing one descriptor id, purely
because the depth experiment holds a model across frames. Two of the five
experiments added in V1 are also stateful, so the callable-only registry
would have meant four more near-identical Module classes.

    1. `cv2.imdecode` returns **None** for a truncated file. Passing that
       to `cvtColor` raises.
    2. `cv2.imdecode` **raises** `!buf.empty()` for an empty buffer -- the

    3. A perfectly valid image with a **1-pixel dimension** decodes fine
       and then kills ORB.

    any exception that is not a `FrameProcessingError` as a MODULE
    failure, `mark_failed()` is terminal (FAILED can never return to
    UNLOADED), and the container is built once at process start with no
    swap path. So a single bad frame would end CV processing for every
    subsequent frame of every subsequent session, for the life of the
    server.

    rectangle -- is drawn over an edge map, which is the same class of

    The alternative was the real frame with the display filter from

    - it needs vendored YuNet weights, so a Tower without them shows
      nothing at all, and "the debug viewer is blank" is a bad failure
      mode for a debug viewer;
    - a display filter is a filter and not a redaction, and the moment a

      is -- which that module itself measures as finding a real face in 4
      of 36 inspected fills;
    - an edge map is enough for the job. A person can tell a chair from a
      doorway from a monitor in one, and that is all a box or a keypoint
      needs to be placed against.

    It is NOT a claim that an edge map is anonymous. It keeps a jawline,

    There is a fourth method, `describe() -> dict`, which is **optional**
    and deliberately not declared here. An experiment that holds a model
    implements it to report what it actually loaded -- the resolved
    device, the weights, the threshold -- because `TOWER_CV_DEVICE=auto`

    copy, and clearing its own slot as it goes, so the array has exactly
    one owner at every instant and neither side has to defend against
    the other mutating it.

    `take_preview` returns `None` when there is nothing to hand over,
    which is the normal answer immediately after a take and the only
    answer while capture is off. Neither may raise: a preview is a
