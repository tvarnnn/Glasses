"""How much is the scene moving, and how coherently.

Sparse Lucas-Kanade rather than dense Farneback. Measured on this host at
640x360: 2.9 ms against 25.4 ms for the same headline number. The dense
field is a better picture and an 8.8x worse deal, and the benchmark keeps
the comparison so the choice stays evidence rather than habit.

Stateful, because flow is a statement about a PAIR of frames. The first
frame of a session therefore has no answer, and this reports that
honestly -- zero tracked, magnitude zero, `has_reference` 0 -- rather
than inventing a still scene.

Forward-backward error is measured, not assumed: a track is kept only if
following it back lands near where it started. Without that check, flow
in a textureless region returns confident nonsense.

A STALE reference is treated as no reference. The module is
process-scoped, so without this the first frame of a new wearer session
is silently diffed against the last frame of the previous one -- possibly
minutes old, possibly a different room -- and reported with
`has_reference: 1.0` as though nothing were wrong. Holding a frame of
wearer imagery indefinitely is also the wrong posture for a module
declaring `retains_raw_imagery=False`.

The residual case this does NOT cover: a new session starting inside the
staleness window still inherits the previous one's frame. Closing that
needs a session-boundary hook on the module contract, which is the
blocked V1.0/V1.1 work. The gap is named rather than papered over.
