"""What objects are in view, as a measurement rather than a product.

This exists for one concrete reason: a Scene Understanding cartridge
needs to choose a detector, and the module doc's promotion path says
measure in the Lab before promoting. COCO gives `person`, `chair` and
`dining table` -- literally the example questions that cartridge is meant
to answer -- so this is the measurement that decision needs.

`ssdlite320_mobilenet_v3_large` from torchvision, which is already an
installed dependency: 13.4 MB of weights, ~31 ms per frame on this CPU at
640x360. No new dependency earns its cost here.

**Output is model inference, not measured fact** (Rule 16, Core Principle
2). A detection is evidence that something scored above a threshold, and
the score is reported alongside the count so a consumer can see how thin
the evidence is. Nothing here establishes identity, and nothing persists.

        # What it measured (2026-08-27, this file's previous comment):
        # an idle developer machine, same-process interleaved A/B, 480
        # timed frames per device, CUDA warmed up first --
        #
        #     object_detection   cpu 29.41 ms   cuda 38.17 ms   CPU faster
        #     depth              cpu 20.03 ms   cuda 10.41 ms   CUDA faster
        #
        # CUDA lost all eight blocks, and the explanation was sound:
        # MobileNetV3 at an internal 320 px is bound by kernel-launch
        # overhead rather than arithmetic, so a GPU has nothing to win.
        #
        # What a real Tower measured. Physical testing on the glasses ->
        # phone -> Tower path, 2026-08-29, reported a mean of 199 ms per
        # frame with a worst frame of 4,483 ms -- seven times the figure
        # above, and a stall long enough that the event loop this runs
        # synchronously on stopped answering every socket for four and a
        # half seconds. Reproduced here under CPU contention: elevated
        # latency persisted for THIRTY consecutive frames and then
        # decayed, which is not the shape of a warm-up (paid once) and is
        # exactly the shape of a shared thread pool losing cores. Under
        # the SAME contention CUDA held 40-50 ms per frame, every frame.
        #
        # The two measurements do not contradict each other. The first
        # was taken with nothing else running; a Tower ships with
        # `scene_autostart` on and `scene_device` = "cpu", so the machine
        # this experiment actually runs on always has another CPU-resident
        # detector on it, and `config.py`'s own `scene_torch_threads`
        # comment already says the torch thread pool is process-global and
        # shared. The idle case is the one that does not happen.
        #
        # So the trade is: give up about 9 ms in a condition that does not
        # occur, to avoid losing 150 ms and multi-second event-loop stalls
        # in the one that does. The outputs are equivalent -- same labels,
        # boxes agreeing to 0.018 px and scores to 0.0004 -- so nothing is
        # bought with correctness.
        #
        # `config.py`'s `scene_device` comment still says CUDA is 30.4 ms
        # against CPU's 32.9 ms for this model. Left standing rather than
        # edited: a THIRD figure, on a different harness, that nothing
        # here re-ran. A successor re-measuring `scene_device` should know
        # all three exist, and should measure under load.

        doing exactly what a COCO detector does when a head-mounted camera
        points at the wearer's own hands. Investigation found the third --
