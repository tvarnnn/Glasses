"""How usable is this frame, before anything expensive looks at it.

Every cartridge has some version of this question and World Builder
already answers a private one. The Lab's job is to make the signals
measurable side by side so a threshold gets chosen from a distribution
rather than from taste -- and to make the cost of asking visible, since a
gate that costs more than the work it skips is not a gate.

All six measurements are computed from one decode and one grayscale
conversion. Sharpness is the headline because it is the one that
separates most sharply: a Laplacian variance falls roughly 17x between a
sharp frame and a blurred one, which is a far bigger margin than any of
the others offer.
