    """The one Lab slot in the container. What is IN it is `CVLab`'s job.

    This class used to hold the experiment itself. It no longer does, and
    the reason is not tidiness: an experiment chosen at runtime has a
    lifecycle of its own -- armed, paused, swapped, failed and retried --
    and none of those are module transitions. Folding them into
    `ModuleState` would have meant either a module that goes READY and
    ACTIVE several times a minute, or `mark_failed()` (which is TERMINAL)
    firing because a weight download timed out.

    So the split is: the container drives this module exactly as it always
    did, once, at startup; and `CVLab` drives what the module is holding.
    A failed experiment leaves the Lab recoverable and the module ACTIVE,
    which is what makes "try the next experiment" a request rather than a
    restart.

    `data_behavior` still declares no persistence and no retained imagery,
    and that must stay true: an experiment that wanted to persist would
    make this descriptor a lie, and the descriptor is what the privacy
    policy is enforced against.
