# Load gets its own bound, and it is deliberately two orders of magnitude
# looser than the others. The number comes from what a first load
# actually has to do, measured on this host's caches rather than chosen
# for roundness:
#
#   * depth (MiDaS-small) downloads 85.8 MB of weights plus a 33.2 MB
#     tf_efficientnet_lite3 backbone -- 119 MB -- and clones two
#     torch.hub repositories before any of it;
#   * object_detection / the shared SSDLite detector downloads 14.1 MB.
#
# 119 MB inside the 10 s general bound demands ~95 Mbit/s sustained from
# the first byte, including TLS setup and GitHub redirects. No ordinary
# link guarantees that, so enforcing 10 s on load would not have fixed a
# hang -- it would have converted "hangs once, then works forever" into
# "fails every first run until somebody pre-warms the cache", which is
# the worse bug. 120 s covers the same download at ~8 Mbit/s.
#
# It is still a bound, not a surrender. A WARM load of the same models
# measures 1.8 s (depth, CUDA, cached) and 0.16 s (SSDLite, CPU, cached)
# on this host, so 120 s is roughly 65x the real cost: a genuinely stuck
# load -- a stalled download, an unreachable host -- is still caught, in
# bounded time, by a Tower that then reports FAILED instead of hanging.
#
# start/stop/unload keep the tight bound. None of them touch the network.
