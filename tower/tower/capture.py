"""Recording raw frames to disk, as an explicit dataset session.

SHARED infrastructure, not a cartridge's. It lives here rather than under
tower/world_builder/ because the transport arms it and any cartridge might
want it -- Text/Document will want OCR-quality stills, Object Memory
occasional high-value frames. Versioning a recording made by the SHARED
transport with a CARTRIDGE's schema constant would mean a geometry-driven
schema bump invalidating capture journals that have nothing to do with
geometry, so this module owns its own version and time basis.

Separate from any keyframe corpus on purpose. A mapper persists a SELECTED
subset of frames; this records everything, because the two jobs it exists
for both need unselected frames:

- camera calibration, which needs board views chosen by a human holding a
  board, not by a parallax policy;
- re-running the V0.9.3 experiments on real DAT footage, which is the
  standing acceptance gate on every dataset-based conclusion the project
  has drawn.

Neither is possible today: a filesystem search found no stored Ray-Ban
footage anywhere, which is why this exists at all.

It is OFF BY DEFAULT and bounded in both duration and bytes. Under
06-PRIVACY-DATA this is an Explicit Dataset-Recording Session: manually
started and stopped, bounded, purgeable, and visibly recording. It is not
incidental capture, and it must never become the default path.
