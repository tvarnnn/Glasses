"""The CV Lab's status, as a result-channel `Snapshot`.

Thin on purpose. `CVLab.status()` already builds the one document every
CV Lab surface serves -- `GET /cv-lab`, the socket's `cv_lab_status`
reply, and this -- and a producer that reshaped it here would create a
third version of the truth that only the result channel ever sees.

**This is the first producer in this package that reads LIVE state rather
than files.** The package header says the channel is "a read-only
reporting surface over state other processes have already persisted", and
that sentence is now half right: it is still read-only, still writes
nothing, still runs no cartridge and still touches no frame. What changed
is where the state lives. World Builder's producer reads a directory
another process wrote; this one reads an object in this process that the
frame path mutates. The distinction that matters is not disk-versus-
memory, it is that neither producer can alter what it reports --
`test_the_result_channel_never_writes` and
`test_the_module_container_is_untouched_by_a_subscription` are the two
gates on that, and both still hold.

The concurrency this introduces is real and is handled where the state
is, not here: `ResultHub.poll_once` computes snapshots with
`asyncio.to_thread`, so `status()` runs on a worker thread while the
event loop is mutating the Lab. `CVLab` takes a lock around every state
transition and around building the document. This module inherits that
and adds nothing of its own.

`revision` is derived from the payload rather than counted, so it cannot
drift from the content -- but three of the figures in it advance with
WALL CLOCK rather than with anything happening, and those are excluded
before hashing.

An earlier version of this module claimed the opposite: "every figure
that moves here moves because a frame was processed". It does not.
`elapsed_s` and the two throughput rates derived from it change on every
read, so `compute_revision` produced a new value on every poll and
`revision_changed: true` -- the field the channel defines as "news, not a
heartbeat" -- fired twice a second on a Lab that had seen no frame at
all. Measured over the wire: four polls, zero new frames, four distinct
revisions.

`capacity_fps` is NOT excluded: it is derived from measured per-frame
cost alone and moves only when a frame is processed. Nor is
`source.receiving_frames`, which flips without a frame arriving but flips
precisely BECAUSE frames stopped arriving -- that is the news.

    Shaped like a status document with everything hollow rather than as a
    bare error, so a client decodes one thing whichever it gets. The
    lifecycle state is `unavailable`, which iOS renders as "the Tower
    cannot do this" rather than as "wait a moment" -- a different
    instruction to a person, and the right one.

    The contract identifiers are REAL, not null. They describe what this
    BUILD speaks, which is true whether or not a Lab is loaded -- and the
    whole point of iOS's third state ("offered, implemented, unreachable")
    is that those are separable. An earlier version nulled them, which
    would have handed a client an identifier to compare for equality that
    could never equal anything.

    Used by the result channel's producer and by the control-plane
    handler, so that a refusal on a Tower with no Lab still carries a
    document.
