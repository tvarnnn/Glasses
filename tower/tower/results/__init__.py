"""The Tower -> iOS structured cartridge result channel.

A READ-ONLY reporting surface over state that has already been produced
elsewhere. Nothing in this package runs a cartridge, drives a module,
touches a frame, or writes anything. It answers one question -- "what does
the Tower currently know about cartridge X?" -- from files on disk, or,
since 2026-08-27, from a live session object it is handed and may only
read.

That restraint is the architecture, not an accident of scope. The obvious
alternative was to register World Builder as a live production module and
publish its results as they were computed; `TOWER-TO-IOS.md` 6.1 lists the
four blockers that stop, and every one of them is real. But 6.1 also
conflates two things that turn out to be separable:

    a World Builder TRANSPORT        <- achievable now, this package
    World Builder as a LIVE MODULE   <- blocked at V1.0/V1.1

The blockers are all properties of the second. `process()` being
synchronous and `bytes`-only, `ExperimentResult` being scalar-shaped,
`_build_cv_module` being a registry of one, `LIFECYCLE_TIMEOUT_S` being
too short for a build -- none of them bear on a reader that never joins
the frame path at all.

**Scene Understanding is the case that does not fit that sentence**, and
it is worth saying how it was resolved rather than leaving the header
above quietly false. It persists nothing by design -- enforced, not
intended -- so there is no file for a reader to read, and the
journal-follower pattern that gave Object Memory a route is unavailable to
it. It is nonetheless served here, because the separation that matters
survived: the LIVE part is `tower/scene/live.py`, which owns a worker
thread and a model and is constructed by `tower/cartridge_runtime.py`;
this package is handed the resulting session object and may only call
`status()` and `latest()` on it. `test_the_result_channel_never_writes`
forbids a call named `observe` or `build` anywhere under `tower/results/`
and so mechanically prevents that handle from becoming a second frame
path.

    """A callable turning (cartridge, result_type, world, session) into a Snapshot.

    Built once and handed to the hub, so the hub itself imports no
    cartridge and can be tested against a stub. Producers are constructed
    lazily and reused, because the World Builder producer holds a small
    per-target cache that would be thrown away on every poll otherwise.

    `scene_source` and `document_source` are LIVE SESSION OBJECTS rather
    than roots, and the asymmetry with `world_root` is the whole point of
    the header above: those two cartridges are not reading a file that
    another process wrote, they are reporting on work happening in this
    process. They are passed in rather than constructed here so this
    module still imports nothing that owns a thread or a model, and so a
    test can drive the whole channel with a stub that has never seen
    torch.

    Both are optional and default to None, which produces an explicit
    `unavailable` snapshot rather than an exception -- the same
    under-promise-on-omission rule `registry.declare` follows.
