"""The World Builder status producer: a READER, never a second pipeline.

The web process does not build worlds and must not start. Reconstruction
runs in its own process (`scripts/world_build_session.py`), which is the
decision `plan.md` 28 protects and the closeout report defends at length:
the frame path pays nothing for a rebuild precisely because the rebuild is
somewhere else. This module reads what that process has already persisted
and shapes it for the wire. It calls no engine method, holds no engine
object, and starts nothing.

Everything reported here is derived from four things on disk:

    LOCK              a pid file, held for the LIFETIME OF A SESSION
    events.jsonl      the append-only journal, dense event_id per session
    session.json      written at start and rewritten at stop -- see below
    derived/manifest  what the last build produced

The single most important fact about the second and third of those:

    session.json is written at start_session() with frames_observed=0 and
    keyframes_accepted=0, and is not rewritten until stop_session().

(engine.py start_session, stop_session.) So DURING a live session those
counts on disk are stale zeros. Reporting them would be the exact failure
`IOS-to-Tower.md` 1.8 warns about -- "nil and 0 are different claims and
are kept different all the way to the screen" -- with the added insult
that the zero looks like a measurement. The live keyframe count is
therefore counted from `keyframe_accepted` events instead, and
`frames_observed` is reported as UNAVAILABLE while a session is live,
because no event is written for an ordinary rejected frame (engine.py
observe: `_note_rejected` without an append for every reason except
malformed_frame). Tower genuinely does not know it yet, and says so.

    """Parse a file only when it has actually changed.

    A measured necessity, not an optimisation. `WorldStore.read_events`
    reads and JSON-parses the ENTIRE journal on every call -- the
    `after_event_id` cursor filters *after* the full read (store.py), so a
    cursor buys nothing. Measured on this host:

        100 events        0.27 ms
        1,000 events      2.35 ms
        10,000 events    26.6 ms
        50,000 events   209 ms

    against a measured frame reply of 1.98 ms average and 15.25 ms worst
    ever observed. A poll loop doing that read twice a second would spend
    more time parsing a journal than the Tower spends answering frames,
    and `asyncio.to_thread` does not save it: the work is `json.loads`,
    which holds the GIL, so offloading turns one 35 ms stall into many
    5 ms ones.

    A `stat()` costs **0.0135 ms** -- roughly 2,000x less at 10k events.
    And because every file here is either append-only or replaced whole,
    (size, mtime_ns) is a sound fingerprint: an append always grows the
    file, and an atomic replace always changes both.

    This also shrinks a genuine WINDOWS hazard. An open read handle in
    this process makes `Path.replace()` fail with WinError 5 in the
    *builder* process -- so a reader that opens files it did not need to
    can break the writer it is only supposed to be watching. Not opening
    them is the strongest available mitigation.

    """Poses carrying a position that is EVIDENCE.

    This used to be `keyframes - poses_refused`, and that arithmetic is
    what put "Camera poses: 36" on the phone during the 2026-08-24
    physical walk, from a manifest reading `poses_solved: 0, points: 0,
    backend_id: "unposed", segments: 36`.

    `engine.build` counts an ANCHOR as neither solved nor refused, so
    subtraction quietly promotes every anchor to a camera position. An
    anchor is definitional, not measured -- identity rotation, zero
    translation -- and `backends/unposed.py` says the status exists
    precisely so "a downstream consumer [cannot] count it as evidence".
    All 36 of those anchors were the same point.

    But an anchor IS a real position when the chain it anchors resolved:
    it is that segment's origin, and dropping it would under-report
    every segment by one. The rule is therefore per segment, which only
    the build can evaluate, so the build now records the answer as
    `poses_positioned` instead of leaving it to be inferred here.
