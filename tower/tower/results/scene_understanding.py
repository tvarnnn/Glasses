"""Live-scene transport adapter for Scene Understanding.

Named after its cartridge, for the reason `world_builder.py` and
`object_memory.py` are: an adapter named after one cartridge cannot leak
that cartridge's assumptions into the next, because the next one gets its
own file.

THIS FILE PROJECTS. IT DOES NOT DRIVE.

It is handed a `SceneState` that a worker thread already produced and
turns it into JSON. It never calls `SceneEngine.observe`, never decodes a
frame and never starts anything -- `test_the_result_channel_never_writes`
forbids a call named `observe` or `build` anywhere under `tower/results/`,
and that prohibition is doing real work here rather than being an
inconvenience: a results module that could drive an engine would be a
second, unsynchronised frame path.

WHAT THIS PAYLOAD MAY NOT SAY, AND WHY THE REASONING IS NOT THE OBVIOUS ONE

The reflex is "minimise disclosure". That reflex is wrong here and the
correct analysis is narrower:

    Tower -> phone is inside the local-first boundary. THE PHONE SENT THE
    PIXELS. A count therefore discloses strictly LESS than the frame the
    phone already holds, and withholding it while shipping frames is
    theatre.

What is genuinely new is **joinability**. A stable `track_id` plus a
timestamp lets a recipient assemble the per-person dwell timeline this
cartridge refuses to keep -- persists-nothing laundered onto the consumer.
The cartridge's best property would be defeated not by what it says but
by what someone could accumulate from it.

So, for people: no `track_id`, no bounding box, no `normalised_x` or
`view_offset`, no per-person facing state, and no `visible_eyes` /
`visible_ears`. Facial-landmark evidence does not cross this boundary at
all. Facing is an aggregate count or an explicit `null` with a reason --
never zero, because zero is an answer and "never measured" is not.

`where` therefore excludes `person` and carries SIDE COUNTS rather than a
side. One side per label cannot describe a chair on the left and a chair
on the right, and picking one of them would be a wrong answer where a
refusal was available.

REFUSED RELATIONS ARE UNEXPRESSIBLE, NOT MERELY UNPOPULATED

`relations` is `None` and there is no schema slot anywhere below that
could hold `in_front_of`. A refusal that depends on remembering not to
fill a field is not a refusal. `refused_relations` names them so a client
can say WHY rather than showing an empty list that looks like "nothing is
near anything".

EVERY COUNT IS AN UNDERCOUNT AND MUST SAY SO

Measured against a `fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn_v2` oracle over 14,128 real
frames (`docs/superpowers/research/2026-08-26-detector-oracle-and-the-
size-floor.md`), the shipped detector's recall is 0.306 for `person`,
0.497 for `cell phone`, 0.209 for `tv`, and it is effectively blind below
~2% of frame area (recall 0.000 under 1%). Because the oracle shares COCO
training data with the shipped model, 0.306 is an UPPER BOUND.

An undercount published without that disclosure looks exactly like a quiet
room, which is why `count_is_lower_bound` and `count_limitations` are
required fields rather than documentation.

EVERY BOOLEAN IS WRAPPED IN `bool()`

`bool` subclasses `int` in Python. A `registered: 1` already shipped once
in this repository and would fail every Swift `as? Bool` decode.
