"""The generic envelope every cartridge result travels in.

Small on purpose. `IOS-to-Tower.md` section 6 lists seventeen things iOS
deliberately did not assume, and most of them are payload-shaped
(geometry representation, pose schema, relation predicates, metric
names). A big universal schema would have to decide those centrally, on
behalf of cartridges that have not been written yet. So the envelope
carries only what is true of EVERY result -- who produced it, under which
agreement, in what order, when -- and the payload stays each cartridge's
own business.

The envelope is deliberately NOT a delta format. See publisher.py for why
snapshots are the whole design rather than an implementation choice.
