"""The capability declaration: which cartridges the Tower can serve.

`IOS-to-Tower.md` section 7 makes this the single most valuable thing the
Tower can build first:

    "Without it, every cartridge is stuck at 'the Tower says nothing',
     and no other work on this list can be shown at all. It is also the
     smallest."

Section 0.1 names the three states iOS must be able to keep apart,
because they call for opposite user responses:

    the Tower says nothing about this cartridge   -> "not built yet"
    the Tower offers a contract this build
        does not implement                        -> "update the app"
    the Tower offers a contract this build
        implements, but is unreachable            -> "connect"

That third state is why `available` is separate from `contract`. A
World Builder with no world root configured still OFFERS the contract --
this build knows how to speak it -- it just has nothing to serve. Folding
that into "no contract" would tell a person to update an app that is
already correct.

This is NOT dynamic module discovery. `04-MODULE-SYSTEM.md` forbids that
before V1.0, and iOS says so itself: it "caches a declaration rather than
fetching a registry". The set below is a static, hand-maintained
declaration compiled into this build. Nothing here enumerates loaded
modules, and nothing here can grow at runtime.

TWO LISTS, BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO TRANSPORTS.

`cartridges` is what can be SUBSCRIBED to: each entry is a
`(cartridge, result_type)` pair the result socket will serve.
`http_contracts` is what can be FETCHED, and it exists because iOS
caches a declaration -- a contract discoverable only by making a call is
a contract a phone cannot plan around, and Document Memory's library was
exactly that.

Only Document Memory's is listed today. World Builder's geometry and
Object Memory's observations are the same shape and are not declared;
adding them would mean importing their identifiers here, and this module
must stay cartridge-blind (`test_the_result_channel_core_is_cartridge_
blind`). Their identifiers live in adapter modules rather than in
`contracts.py`, so those two lanes own that move.

# are iOS's "the Tower says nothing about this cartridge" case, and the

# does not know what document_memory is" and "Tower knows and is not
# serving it yet". iOS keys on `cartridges`; this list is for humans.
#
# Document Memory and Scene Understanding left this list on 2026-08-27.
# They did not leave it because they got better -- Document Memory's
# detector still fires on essentially nothing at the geometry the glasses
# deliver. They left it because their limits became things the PAYLOAD
# STATES, which is what an offer is for. `not_offered` is for a cartridge
# that can say nothing at all; a cartridge that can say "I have observed
# nothing, and here is precisely why" belongs in `cartridges`, available
# or not.
# As of this integration the tuple is EMPTY, and that is a claim, not
# an oversight: every cartridge with a wire contract in this build now
# has an OFFER, available or not. Document Memory and Scene
# Understanding left on 2026-08-27 and the Experimental CV Lab left with
# `experimental_cv.status/2026-08-27`.
#
# OBJECT MEMORY IS IN NEITHER LIST, deliberately. Its identifier exists
# in `contracts.py` and its control surface is live at
# `/cartridges/{cartridge}/session`, but declaring it here breaks a
# pinned iOS test, so the socket declaration waits for the iOS lane to
# take both halves at once. See the note at CARTRIDGE_OBJECT_MEMORY.

    """The full capability declaration.

    Takes its inputs rather than reading configuration itself so the
    declaration is a pure function of them -- which is what lets one test
    assert that the HTTP route and the WebSocket message produce
    byte-identical output. Passing the app instead would have made the
    function impure again, which is why three cartridges' worth of state
    arrives as three arguments and not as one `app`.

    Every argument past `world_root` is keyword-only WITH A DEFAULT, and
    that is a decision about what an omission should mean rather than a
    convenience. A caller that has not been taught about a cartridge gets
    that cartridge declared and UNAVAILABLE -- never silently offered as
    working. So the failure mode of forgetting to thread a value through
    is a Tower that under-promises, which iOS renders as "connect", and
    not one that promises a channel it cannot serve. Use
    `declaration_inputs(app_state)` rather than assembling them by hand.

    `cv_lab` is DUCK-TYPED, never imported: anything with an
    `availability()` returning `(available, reason)`. This module is part
    of the result channel cartridge-blind core and
    `test_the_result_channel_core_is_cartridge_blind` keeps it that way;
    an import of the Lab here would bake one cartridge into the shared
    surface, and this time the surface is a WIRE CONTRACT.

    Availability is about whether a session COULD BE STARTED, never about
    current activity. A Scene Understanding that is enabled but stopped is
    `available: true` -- it can be started -- and its payload says
    `lifecycle.state: "stopped"`. Folding "not running right now" into
    "unavailable" would tell a person their Tower cannot do this when in
    fact nobody has pressed Start, and those two call for opposite
    responses.

    That used to read "about CONFIGURATION", which was the intent but not
    the whole truth, and the gap was reachable. Scene Understanding needs
    torch, which ships in the optional `[ml]` extra; on a host without it
    the session constructed anyway (the default device is `cpu`, and only
    a non-cpu device imported torch), so this function was handed
    `scene_enabled=True` and promised a cartridge that failed ~50 ms into
    Start. The caller now imports the dependency while constructing, so
    what arrives here is the same answer it always claimed to be.

    `scene_unavailable_reason` exists because the fix made a second defect
    common. `SCENE_DISABLED_REASON` names the environment variable, which
    is right when nobody switched the cartridge on and WRONG when they
    did and construction failed -- it sends an operator to check the one
    thing that is already correct. It is `or`-ed, so an omitted reason
    keeps the pinned configured-off wording exactly.
