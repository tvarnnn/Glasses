"""Library and session transport adapter for Document Memory.

Named after its cartridge, for the reason `world_builder.py`,
`world_builder_geometry.py` and `object_memory.py` are: an adapter named
after one cartridge cannot leak that cartridge's assumptions into the
next, because the next one gets its own file.

THIS FILE READS. IT DOES NOT DELETE, AND IT DOES NOT OCR.

`DocumentStore` can `purge()` and `prune_expired()`. Neither is reachable
from here and neither may become reachable -- an unauthenticated HTTP
endpoint that erases what a wearer read is not a feature. Deletion stays
with `scripts/document_query.py --purge`, where a human types it.
`DocumentMemoryEngine` can `observe()`. That is not reachable from here
either, and `test_the_result_channel_never_writes` fails on a call named
`observe` anywhere under `tower/results/`.

THE THREE ANSWERS, AND WHY TWO WOULD BE A LIE

`IOS-to-Tower.md` 3.5 is the sharpest requirement on this cartridge and
the easiest to get wrong:

    matched        documents were found
    notFound       the memory was searched and nothing matched
    noObservation  the memory holds nothing covering what was asked

Collapsing the third into the second lets a gap in what the glasses
happened to see read as a statement about the world. That distinction is
not decoration here -- it is this cartridge's ACTUAL STATE. On 9,199
frames of real first-person footage the page detector fired six times and
was wrong all six, and after `MIN_ROW_TRANSITIONS` was re-derived against
those same frames it fires zero times. A Tower asked "show me the parking
notice" today answers `no_observation`, and that is the truthful answer:
nothing has ever been recorded, and that is a fact about this platform's
camera, not about parking notices.

`RECORDING_LIMITATIONS` carries that on every response. A client that
renders an empty library as "no documents yet" would be inviting a person
to wait for something that is not coming.

THE LIST CARRIES A CHARACTER COUNT, NOT THE TEXT

`IOS-to-Tower.md` 3.2: "The list carries a character count, not the text,
so a list of documents is not also a bulk transfer of every document's
contents onto the phone. Full text is fetched when a person opens one."

That is the manifest/segment split `world_builder_geometry.py` already
uses, applied to the most sensitive data this platform handles.
`text_availability` is the typed form of iOS's `unknown` / `notReadable`
/ `extracted(characterCount:)`, and `not_readable` is a REAL ANSWER: "we
looked and found no readable text" is a different fact from "we never
looked", and the store records both.

NAMES THAT ARE PART OF THE CONTRACT

WHY THE CAVEATS ARE AT THE ENVELOPE AND NOT ON EVERY RECORD

`record_notes` carries, once, the five sentences that used to be repeated
on every document: the "in view, not read" qualification, the summary's
provenance, the clock, the capture-side imagery lifetime, and the
joinability of the frame reference. They are constants, and a
200-document listing was 488 KB with two thirds of it the same sentences
two hundred times.

They are hoisted, never dropped. Each is a caveat a client must be able
to render, and deleting a caveat to save bytes is the one saving this
contract may not make.

The duration field is `observed_seconds`, and it must never be renamed to
anything built on the word "viewing". `IOS-to-Tower.md` 3.3 asks for that
by name and gives the reason: "appearing in the camera does not establish
that the wearer looked at it, noticed it, or read it"; a field named for
viewing claims all three. iOS renders it as "In view 45s", never "viewed
for" or "read for". The literal banned spelling is not written out here,
because the vocabulary test in `tests/test_result_channel_isolation.py`
greps every string in this package for it -- docstrings included -- and a
rule that exempted the file explaining the rule is how the word gets back
in. That is also why this paragraph does not quote the test's own name.
