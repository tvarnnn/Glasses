"""Observation transport adapter for Object Memory.

Named after its cartridge, for the same reason `world_builder.py` and
`world_builder_geometry.py` are: an adapter named after one cartridge
cannot leak that cartridge's assumptions into the next, because the next
one gets its own file. `tower/routes/observations.py` imports only this
module and never reaches `tower.object_memory` directly.

THIS FILE READS. IT DOES NOT DELETE.

`ObservationStore` also has `purge()` and `prune_expired()`. Neither is
reachable from here, and neither may become reachable. An unauthenticated
HTTP endpoint that erases a wearer's memory is not a feature, and
06-PRIVACY-DATA.md's real deletion stays where a human types it: the
`--purge-all` flag on `scripts/object_query.py`.

WHAT THIS PAYLOAD IS ALLOWED TO CLAIM

Every observation carries `spatial_ref: None`. The field is reserved,
never populated, and actively nulled on read -- nothing in this cartridge
knows where anything is in a room. So the payload answers "where" as a
FRAME REFERENCE: a capture id, a frame sequence number, a camera, and a
box in normalised frame coordinates. That is a pointer back into a
recording, not a place.

The names below are the enforcement. A doc that says "do not read this as
a location" is advice; a field called `where.kind == "frame-reference"`
with `spatial_ref` sitting next to it as an explicit null is a shape that
makes an overclaiming client awkward to write. Three claims are therefore
carried IN the payload rather than only in `docs/contracts/OBJECT-MEMORY.md`:

  claim          a category was VISIBLE ONCE -- not that it is there now
  identity       a CATEGORY, not an instance. Not "your" laptop.
  absence_means  no record is a statement about what this cartridge
                 captured, never about what is in the world

`spatial_ref` is carried as an explicit `null` rather than omitted, so a
consumer can see that the field exists and is empty. An absent key looks
like a version skew; a null is an answer.
