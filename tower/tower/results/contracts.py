"""Contract identifiers, and why they are opaque strings.

`IOS-to-Tower.md` section 6 item 6 is explicit that iOS compares contract
identifiers **for equality only**:

    "Contract versioning semantics -- identifiers are compared for
     equality only, so ordering and compatibility remain the Tower's to
     define."

and section 0.1 that the identifier is "an **opaque identifier compared
for equality** (`CartridgeContract`)" which "deliberately does *not*
assume integer versions, ordering, or backward compatibility".

So these are strings, not integers, and nothing may parse them. That is a
deliberate departure from `tower/world_builder/schema.py: SCHEMA_VERSION`,
which is an int -- and the two are not in tension, because they answer
different questions. SCHEMA_VERSION governs whether THIS BUILD can read a
file THIS PROJECT wrote, where a monotonic int and a refuse-on-unknown
rule are right. A contract identifier governs whether ANOTHER MACHINE,
built and shipped separately, implements the agreement we are offering --
and there the only sound operation is equality, because a phone in the
App Store cannot be assumed to know anything about an identifier minted
after it shipped.

Dated rather than numbered, for the same reason: a date makes it obvious
that two identifiers differ without inviting anyone to compute which is
"greater".

Changing a value here is a WIRE BREAK. iOS will report "update the app"
and stop decoding, which is the intended behaviour -- see
`IOS-to-Tower.md` section 0.1. Change one only when the payload's meaning
changes in a way an existing decoder would get WRONG. Adding an optional
field that an older decoder ignores is not that; removing a field,
renaming one, or changing what a field means is.

# Document Memory's result type is `status` -- and there it is the right
# word, because the payload really is progress: how long this Tower has
# been watching for documents, how many it has recorded, whether it is
# mid-dwell. The documents themselves do not travel here. They are bulk,
# they are text, and a list of them belongs on HTTP for the same reason

# MEANING, not merely because a field was added. It used to be
# `keyframes - poses_refused`, which counts a segment anchor -- an
# identity rotation at the origin, by construction -- as a camera
# position. On the 2026-08-24 physical walk that reported "36 camera
# poses" from a build whose manifest read `poses_solved: 0, points: 0`.
#
# A consumer pinned to the old identifier is refused rather than quietly
# served a number that means something different. That is what "compare
# for equality only; a mismatch means we are not talking about the same
# agreement" is for, and a correction is exactly the case where serving
# the old id would be a lie about compatibility. Adding `poses_anchor`
# alone would not have justified this; changing what an existing figure
# counts does.
