"""Persisted record shapes for World Builder.

Follows tower/object_memory/records.py: frozen dataclasses, explicit
to_json_dict / *_from_json_dict, reserved-but-unused fields carried from
day one so a later need does not require rewriting already-persisted
records, and confidence stored as a LABEL rather than a score.

Confidence itself is imported from object_memory rather than redefined.
Two independently-evolving confidence vocabularies with the same four
labels is exactly the silent-divergence failure Rule 16 exists to prevent.
Rule 6 ("modules own their data") governs data, not a shared vocabulary --
importing a frozen enum is not promoting data to a shared service. Revisit
a tower/confidence.py only when a third consumer appears.
