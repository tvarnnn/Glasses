"""Backend for the uncalibrated case: measures, but never poses.

This is the honest answer to the platform's actual situation. Meta DAT 0.9
exposes no intrinsics -- VideoFrame carries a sample buffer and nothing
else -- and the published Ray-Ban field of view describes a 3:4 still,
while the stream is 9:16 through an undocumented crop, so no legitimate
conversion exists. Without intrinsics, an essential matrix cannot be
formed, and a guessed focal length does not degrade the result gracefully:
it yields a bent trajectory that looks entirely plausible.

So this backend returns no poses at all. What it does return is every
measurement that genuinely does not need calibration -- correspondences,
fundamental-matrix inliers, pixel displacement, r_H -- because those are
real evidence about the footage, and because a world that records why it
has no geometry is far more useful than one that is merely empty.

The moment a ChArUco calibration exists, select_backend() picks the
classical backend instead and the same pipeline starts producing poses.
Nothing above this seam changes.
