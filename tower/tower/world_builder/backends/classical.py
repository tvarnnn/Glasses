"""Calibrated incremental structure-from-motion, degeneracy refused.

Runs today, on CPU, with no dependency beyond the OpenCV the Tower
already requires. It needs intrinsics and says so: prepare() raises rather
than substituting a plausible focal length, because a wrong focal length
does not produce slightly-wrong geometry, it produces a confidently wrong
trajectory.

For a two-frame window this is essential matrix + recoverPose. For longer
windows it chains properly: triangulate from the initial pair, then solve
each subsequent camera by PnP against the accumulated landmarks. Chaining
matters -- returning per-pair relative poses for a long window would give
a set of poses that are each individually correct and collectively
meaningless, because two-view translations are unit-length and carry no
common scale.

Scale is arbitrary by construction. The initial pair's baseline is
declared to be one unit, and everything after is consistent with that
choice. That is "relative", not metric, and nothing here pretends
otherwise.

## A refused keyframe is not a dead coordinate frame

This backend used to latch. The first keyframe whose pose could not be
solved set `_Chain.broken`, and every keyframe after it returned
`unavailable` from an early return that skipped ORB detection entirely.
The engine's only available response was to cut a new segment -- a new
coordinate frame, a new arbitrary unit, another fragment the viewer
cannot connect.

Measured across every calibrated session in the corpus: 1,949 refused
poses, of which 1,812 -- 93% -- were keyframes at which NO SOLVER EVER
RAN. Only 137 were an actual attempt that failed. On the 2026-09-01
long-loop walk the manifest's own split is 21 root against 60 cascaded.

So the latch is replaced by a bounded recovery state, which is the
structure every mature monocular SLAM system converges on (ORB-SLAM3's
RECENTLY_LOST between OK and LOST; stella_vslam's tracker retrying
against the local map before its relocalizer). Two things changed and
nothing else did:

1. **References are the last `EXTEND_REFERENCE_DEPTH` keyframes that
   actually HAVE a pose.** A keyframe that refused contributes no
   reference, so the next keyframe is solved against the last known-good
   one rather than against a keyframe with no entry in `absolute` --
   which could not supply a single 3-D correspondence, and so guaranteed
   the next refusal too.

2. **A refusal costs an attempt, not the chain.** `_Chain.failures`
   counts consecutive refusals; only `MAX_RECOVERY_KEYFRAMES` of them in
   a row set `broken`. One refused keyframe stays refused -- honestly,
   with no pose -- and the walk carries on in the same frame.

WHAT WAS TRIED AND REJECTED, because it is the obvious next move and it
is worse: feeding all DEPTH references' correspondences into one PnP.
Measured on the 2026-09-01 walk, against identical recovery behaviour,
it left solved poses flat (329 -> 327) and doubled the reprojection tail
(p99 4.37 -> 8.87 px, 2.21% -> 5.19% of published rows above the 3 px
gate), and the dominant connected component fell from 38.8% of the
geometry to 19.8%. See `_extend` for why: ORB-SLAM's TrackLocalMap
searches a radius around a PREDICTED pose, so appearance only ever
chooses among geometrically plausible candidates. We have no prediction
at that point, so a wider reference set is pure appearance matching over
a wider baseline -- where ORB is weakest.

NO ACCEPTANCE THRESHOLD MOVED. `MIN_PNP_CORRESPONDENCES`,
`PNP_REPROJECTION_ERROR_PX`, `MIN_INLIERS`, `MIN_INLIER_RATIO` and
`MIN_TRIANGULATION_ANGLE_DEG` are the values they were. Recovery is
asking the question again on a later keyframe against a reference that
still has coordinates; it is not lowering the bar for the answer. That
distinction is the whole safety argument, and
tests/test_world_builder_tracking_recovery.py pins both halves of it.

# How many ACCEPTED keyframes back this backend will look for further

# and is the control the benchmark neutralises to.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. 66.1% of landmarks were seen by exactly two views
# (measured on the previous engine; the HEAD figure is Stage 0's job). A
# two-view landmark is exactly determined -- two rays, one intersection
# -- so it constrains nothing, which is why a bundle adjuster measured
# 0.00% improvement here: two-thirds of the map was invisible to it by
# construction, not by any failure of the solver.
#
# WHY 3. Per pair asked, the useful-edge yield falls off a cliff after
# about three keyframes of separation -- roughly 58% at gap 1, 49% at
# gaps 2-5, 30% at 6-20 -- and this pipeline's own gate accepts 50.4 /
# 49.5 / 47.8% at gaps 1 / 2 / 3 before decaying. Gaps 1-3 are flat and
# cheap. Past that the right instrument is retrieval, not a wider sweep.
#
# WHAT IT COSTS. It is NOT pose-neutral, and an earlier draft of this
# comment claiming otherwise was wrong. The older references' associations
# are merged into `observed`, which the next keyframe's PnP draws
# correspondences from, so later poses can move. Withholding them keeps
# poses frozen and publishes a support table naming one image point as two
# landmarks -- measured at 2 such rows at DEPTH=1 against 147 at DEPTH=3 --
# which is worse, because that table is what cross-segment registration
# solves against. See _reobserve_against_pose.
#
# STILL POST-SOLVE, and deliberately. Feeding these references into the
# PnP itself was measured and refused -- see `_extend`'s docstring for
# the numbers. DEPTH sets the width of the support table, not the width
# of the pose solve.
#
# MEASURED, 30 real segments, DEPTH 1 -> 3: >=3-view share rose on 18

# and on every one of those 13 observations-per-landmark ROSE. That is
# duplicate landmarks being merged, not structure being lost -- the same
# reuse `_extend` already performs over a one-frame window, extended to
# DEPTH frames.

# How many CONSECUTIVE keyframes may refuse before the chain is declared
# broken and the engine cuts a new coordinate frame.
#
# WHAT THIS REPLACES. A one-way latch, i.e. this constant was
# effectively 1. The first refusal ended the segment, which is the
# single decision that produced 1,812 of the corpus's 1,949 refused
# poses -- keyframes at which no solver ran because the chain was
# already dead.
#
# WHY A BUDGET AND NOT "NEVER GIVE UP". A camera that has genuinely
# stopped seeing anything it has mapped must be allowed to say so. Every
# mature monocular system bounds this: ORB-SLAM3 gives pure-visual
# RECENTLY_LOST 3.0 seconds (Tracking.cc, the hardcoded 3.0f in the
# non-inertial branch -- the widely-quoted 5.0 is the inertial one)
# before it will consider the map lost; COLMAP retries a failed image
# max_reg_trials = 3 times and re-queues it behind fresher candidates.
#
# WHY THIS NUMBER. Our budget is counted in KEYFRAMES, not frames,
# because that is what this backend steps on. The 2026-09-01 walk
# accepted 434 keyframes in 129 s -- 3.4 keyframes a second -- so
# ORB-SLAM3's 3.0 s is about 10 keyframes here. Swept over the whole

# -- drift control ----------------------------------------------------
#
# THE MEASUREMENT THAT PUT THIS HERE. On a clean synthetic strafe, with
# nothing refused and nothing blurred, this backend's forward-only chain
# drifts monotonically:
#
#     keyframes   rotation error med / max   max drift / path
#          6         0.95 / 1.69 deg               4.7%
#         12         1.69 / 3.46 deg               2.7%
#         20         3.19 / 9.17 deg               9.8%
#         30         5.71 / 18.88 deg             11.3%
#         40         9.21 / 33.98 deg             18.2%
#
# and the per-step recovered/true scale ratio, flat at 7.63 through
# twenty keyframes, falls to 3.46 by thirty and 2.43 by forty: the
# reconstruction CONTRACTS.
#
# That is why a walk does not become a world, and it is a bigger effect
# than the fragmentation everybody can see. A segment longer than about
# twenty keyframes is internally warped, cross-segment registration
# solves a Sim3 and correctly REFUSES two pieces whose geometry
# disagrees, and every extra keyframe of continuity bought by recovery is
# spent making the piece less placeable. Fewer segments without drift
# control is a worse world that looks like a better one.
#
# THE FIX IS BUNDLE ADJUSTMENT, and the record said it would not work:
# a prior attempt measured 0.00% improvement and blamed an observation
# graph whose median covisibility span is 1. That was true then. It is
# not true now -- EXTEND_REFERENCE_DEPTH's guided re-observation built
# the graph the earlier attempt lacked. Measured on the same walk at
# HEAD: mean 4.67 views a landmark, 67.2% with three or more, span
# median 3 / p90 9. And the drift is REACHABLE: the same observations
# reprojected through GROUND-TRUTH poses give RMS 0.49 px against 0.95
# px for the solved ones, so the solved reconstruction is not at the
# minimum.
#
# Measured, this local adjustment over a 24-keyframe chain:
#     rotation error median   3.69 deg -> 0.13 deg
#     scale first/last third  7.63/5.34 -> 9.57/9.42  (drift eliminated)
#     reprojection RMS        1.34 px  -> 0.53 px
#
# WINDOW SIZE. Cameras adjusted together. Wide enough to span the
# ~20-keyframe horizon over which drift becomes visible, small enough
# that the reduced camera system stays trivial (6*12 = 72 square) and
# the cost stays on the keyframe path rather than the frame path.

        `references` is the last EXTEND_REFERENCE_DEPTH keyframes with an
        entry in `absolute`, nearest first. `references[0]` is what the
        pose is solved against; the rest supply further sightings AFTER
        the solve, through `_reobserve_against_pose`.

        WHAT CHANGED, AND WHAT DELIBERATELY DID NOT

        What changed is WHICH keyframe `references[0]` is. It used to be
        `current - 1` unconditionally. It is now the nearest keyframe
        that actually has coordinates, so a keyframe whose pose refused
        is stepped over rather than becoming a reference that cannot
        supply a single 3-D correspondence. That is the whole recovery
        mechanism, and it is the invariant every mature system holds:
        ORB-SLAM sets its reference keyframe only in CreateNewKeyFrame()
        and UpdateLocalKeyFrames(), both reachable only after a
        successful track; DSO sets its coarse tracking reference only
        from makeKeyFrame(), after the window optimisation.

        What deliberately did NOT change is the number of references the
        PnP itself draws correspondences from: ONE.

        Feeding all DEPTH references into a single PnP was implemented
        and MEASURED, because it is the obvious widening and because
        ORB-SLAM's TrackLocalMap is exactly that idea done properly. It
        made the reconstruction WORSE, on the 2026-09-01 walk, against
        the same recovery behaviour:

            references into PnP   solved   reproj p99   over 3 px   dominant
                1                    329       4.37 px      2.21%      38.8%
                3                    327       8.87 px      5.19%      19.8%

        The reason is that TrackLocalMap is not "match more keyframes".
        It projects landmarks through a PREDICTED pose and searches a
        small radius around the prediction, so appearance is only ever
        asked to choose among candidates that are already geometrically
        plausible. We have no pose prediction at this point -- that is
        what we are solving for -- so an older reference contributes
        pure descriptor matches over a wider baseline, where ORB's
        appearance assumption is weakest. RANSAC then has more outliers
        to survive and sometimes does not, and the poses that come out
        reproject twice as badly. Widening the correspondence set is not
        the same act as widening the local map, and only the second one
        is what ORB-SLAM does.

        So the older references keep the job they were measured doing:
        re-observation after the pose exists, gated on reprojecting
        through it. See `_reobserve_against_pose`.

        WHAT THIS IS, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY IS NOT

        The obvious way to widen this backend is to feed several
        references' correspondences into ONE PnP. That is a different and
        larger change: it alters the pose directly, and pricing it
        honestly means measuring it across the corpus. It is a reasonable
        eventual move and it is not this.

        This runs AFTER the pose is solved, so it does not participate in
        solving THIS keyframe. It does, however, affect LATER ones: what
        it admits is merged into `observed`, and `observed` is where the
        next keyframe finds its correspondences. That is a deliberate
        choice and the alternative was measured and rejected -- see the
        comment at the call site. What it buys is how many views each
        landmark is known to have been seen from, which is the quantity a
        pose graph and a bundle adjuster actually consume, and the
        quantity cross-segment
        registration PnPs against.

        WHY A REPROJECTION TEST AND NOT A MATCHER SCORE

        A descriptor match is a claim about appearance. Appearance is
        exactly what fails on repeated indoor texture -- two identical
        chair legs match happily -- and `support.json` is consumed by
        registration, which solves against it. So an association is
        admitted here only if the landmark, projected through the pose we
        just solved, lands within PNP_REPROJECTION_ERROR_PX of the
        feature that claims it.

        That threshold is deliberately not a new number. It is the same
        one `solvePnPRansac` used to decide what counted as an inlier for
        this very pose, so an admitted re-observation is one the pose
        solve itself would have accepted had it been offered. Inventing a
        looser threshold here would be inventing evidence.

        Cheirality is checked too: a landmark behind the camera is
        refused before its pixel distance is even considered, because a
        negative depth can still reproject onto a plausible pixel.

        A current feature already bound by the pose solve is never
        rebound, and the first extra reference to claim a free feature
        keeps it -- references are visited nearest-first, so the claim
        order is fixed and the output does not depend on dict iteration.

        _extend() reads `observed[(reference, f)]` for every keyframe in
        `references` and for nothing else, so once the window has moved
        on nothing will ever look up a frame older than the oldest
        reference. estimate_window() keeps them all because it is over in
        one call. A live solve is not over, and unpruned this dict grows
        by roughly two entries per ORB match per keyframe.

        The bound is `references`, NOT `count - DEPTH`. During recovery
        the references do not advance, so the retained window sits still
        rather than sliding off the last views that have poses -- which
        would delete exactly the correspondences recovery needs. It is
        still a constant: `references` is capped at DEPTH.

        The retained window was one frame when this backend matched only
        its immediate predecessor. It is now DEPTH frames, so the
        constant below is DEPTH times larger -- still a constant, which
        is the property that matters and the one
        test_retained_state_does_not_grow_with_the_number_of_keyframes
        asserts. At DEPTH = 3 that is ~0.45 MB against the ~0.15 MB the
        measurement below records, and it does not grow with the walk.

        `support` is deliberately NOT pruned here. It holds the same
        association and is the reason this backend records anything at
        all about 2-D/3-D linkage, so pruning it would silently give the
        live path one frame's worth of a field the rebuild path fills
        completely. It is affordable precisely because it is not this
        dict: 12 bytes a row against ~200 bytes an entry, so the 26.1 MB
        below is ~1.3 MB, and the 142.9 MB is ~8 MB.

        Measured, 480x360 synthetic walk, retained `observed` unpruned
        against pruned: 26.1 MB vs 0.15 MB at 155 keyframes, 142.9 MB vs
        0.15 MB at 1000. Pruned it is flat, because what survives is one
        frame's features. It changes no output -- which is a claim the
        equivalence test exists to check, not one it is asked to
        tolerate.
