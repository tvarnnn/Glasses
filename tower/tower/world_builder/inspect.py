"""Reading a saved world back, cold, without the session that made it.

Everything here is read-only and process-independent: a world written by
one process is opened by another with no shared state, which is the whole
point of the persistence design.

The reporting discipline is that an unavailable figure prints as
``unknown`` and never as ``0``. Zero is a measurement; unknown is the
absence of one, and collapsing the two is the exact conflation Rule 16
forbids -- "no poses were solved" and "we never tried to solve poses" look
identical once both render as 0.
