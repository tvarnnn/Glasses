"""The cheap per-frame path: decode, score quality, track, summarise motion.

Runs on every delivered frame. Measured at roughly 5 ms per frame at
360x640 against a ~300 ms delivered interval, so it is not a compute
problem and nothing here is optimised for speed at the cost of clarity.

Two disciplines govern this module:

**Nothing here reads a clock.** Frame spacing is variable, the sender
decimates frames, and there is no capture timestamp anywhere on the wire.
Every threshold is in pixels or ratios. A time-based rule would silently
mean something different at 3 fps than at 12 fps, and would confuse "the
user turned quickly" with "the network stalled".

**Nothing here needs intrinsics.** Everything measured is image-space, so
the same measurements are available whether or not the camera has ever
been calibrated -- which is what lets the uncalibrated backend still
report real evidence instead of nothing.

# It advances on an accept (`engine.py:283`), so a run of blurred frames

# 3.0, not 1.0. Round-trip error grows with the distance travelled, and a
# stale reference (see LK_MAX_LEVEL above) makes long hops routine rather
# than exceptional -- so a 1.0 px budget calibrated for adjacent frames
# rejects tracks that are real, turning recoverable drift into declared
# loss. 47 of the 50 losses on the real walk still had frame-to-frame
# survival above the 0.05 floor; only 3 were genuine.
#
# 3.0 is still an eighth of the 21 px search window, so it discriminates.
# Measured with the pyramid change: 51 -> 33 segments on that walk, and
# 171 -> 130 across eight captures.
#
# THIS HALF IS NOT FREE, and an earlier version of this comment claimed it
# was on confounded evidence. Against a known warp, raising 1.0 -> 3.0 at a
# FIXED pyramid level roughly doubles the gross-outlier rate: 0.97% -> 1.74%
# of surviving tracks land beyond 20 px of truth. The pyramid change cuts
# that rate about 6x (6.27% -> 0.97%), so the pair together is a net ~3.6x
# purity improvement -- but the forward-backward half is the weaker and
# costlier half of it, buying only 40 -> 33 segments.
#
# What bounds the damage is that LK tracks never reach the solve.
# `backends/classical.py` re-detects ORB and matches independently, so this
# tolerance decides which frames are PROMOTED, not which correspondences
# are triangulated. And it does not splice: on unrelated frames the
# combined change discriminates BETTER than the baseline, not worse.
#
# (The retired claim, recorded so nobody re-derives it: intra-segment
# solvable pairs rose 46% -> 53% and triangulation angle 0.43 -> 0.63 deg.
# That is confounded. Fewer segments means longer segments means a
# wider-baseline pair population -- median keyframe gap 6 -> 9 -- and
# triangulation angle rises with baseline by construction. It is exactly
# what zero change in track quality would produce.)

    actually landed.

    A homography exactly explains any motion that is pure rotation about
    the camera centre, whatever the scene. So residual near zero means
    "this motion carries no baseline" -- which is the one thing a keyframe
    policy most needs to know and cannot get from displacement.

    Measured separation: 0.107 and 0.120 px for genuinely zero-baseline
    pairs, versus 0.305 to 0.765 px once the camera actually translated.
    Meanwhile raw displacement measured 12.4 px under that SAME pure
    rotation -- larger than the 4.3 px measured for a real 5 cm sideways
    step. Displacement alone would promote exactly the frames that carry
    no geometry.

    It is a rotation DETECTOR, not a parallax magnitude: it is not
    monotonic in baseline, because at wide baselines the surviving tracks
    concentrate on whatever plane dominates the view. Use it to reject,
