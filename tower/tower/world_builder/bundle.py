"""Sparse bundle adjustment: the drift control this pipeline did not have.

WHY THIS EXISTS

Measured on a perfect synthetic strafe, with no tracking failure, no
refusal and no blur -- the shipped forward-only chain drifts:

    keyframes   rotation error (median / max)   max drift / path
        6            0.95 deg / 1.69 deg              4.7%
       12            1.69 deg / 3.46 deg              2.7%
       20            3.19 deg / 9.17 deg              9.8%
       30            5.71 deg / 18.88 deg            11.3%
       40            9.21 deg / 33.98 deg            18.2%

and the per-step recovered/true scale ratio, flat at 7.63 through the
first twenty keyframes, collapses to 3.46 by thirty and 2.43 by forty.
The reconstruction CONTRACTS.

That is the real reason a walk does not become a world. Fragmentation is
the symptom people see; drift is what makes the fragments unmergeable,
because cross-segment registration solves a Sim3 between two segments
and correctly refuses two pieces whose internal geometry disagrees.
Making segments longer without controlling drift trades a visible
failure for an invisible one.

WHY A PRIOR ATTEMPT MEASURED 0.00%, AND WHY THAT IS NOT THE LAST WORD

The record says a bundle adjuster improved drift by 0.00% at 16, 32 and
104 keyframes, and attributes it to an observation graph whose median
covisibility span is 1 -- 66% of landmarks seen by exactly two views, and
a two-view landmark is exactly determined, so it constrains nothing.

That was true of the engine it was measured on. It is not true of this
one. Measured on the same 40-keyframe strafe at HEAD:

    landmarks 5,876   mean views 4.67   >= 3 views 67.2%
    observation span: median 3, p90 9, p99 24; 28% span >= 5 frames

The guided re-observation added by EXTEND_REFERENCE_DEPTH built the
graph the earlier attempt was missing. And the drift is demonstrably
REACHABLE by optimisation rather than baked in: reprojecting the very
same observations through GROUND-TRUTH poses gives RMS 0.49 px against
0.95 px for the solved poses. The solved reconstruction is not at the
minimum. There is something to find.

WHAT THIS IS

Levenberg-Marquardt over camera poses and landmark positions, with the
Schur complement eliminating the landmarks -- the standard structure,
because the normal equations of a bundle problem are block-arrowhead and
solving them densely is the only thing that would make this expensive.
A local window is a few tens of cameras, so the reduced camera system is
a few hundred square and dense linear algebra on it is free; the cost is
all in forming it, which is vectorised.

NumPy and OpenCV only. scipy is not a Tower dependency and this must run
where the rest of the world builder runs.

THE INVARIANT THAT BIT TWICE, stated once so it does not bite again:

    EVERY OBSERVATION OF A CAMERA THAT IS ALLOWED TO MOVE MUST
    PARTICIPATE IN THE OPTIMISATION.

Drop an observation for any reason -- too few views on its landmark, a
per-landmark view cap, a sampling shortcut -- and its landmark stays put
while its camera moves out from under it. The trajectory gets better and
the SUPPORT TABLE, which is what cross-segment registration and the
viewer actually consume, gets worse. Both `MIN_VIEWS_FOR_ADJUSTMENT` and
`MAX_VIEWS_PER_LANDMARK` shipped values that violated this and each
carries the measurement that caught it. A landmark that must not MOVE is
expressed with `fixed_points`, which keeps its observations in the
problem; it is never expressed by removing its rows.

GAUGE. A monocular reconstruction is free up to a similarity: 3 rotation,
3 translation, 1 scale. The Jacobian is therefore rank-deficient by 7 and
an undamped Gauss-Newton step is not unique. LM's damping term makes the
system positive definite, which is the standard resolution and the one
used here -- no parameters are held fixed, so the optimiser is free to
move the whole window and the caller must not assume camera 0 stays at
the origin. `optimise` re-anchors before returning, so that assumption
stays true for everything upstream.

CONVENTION. Poses are T_camera_world: `x_camera = R @ x_world + t`, the
same convention `backends/classical.py` publishes and `_triangulate_new`
projects with. Rotation increments are applied on the LEFT
(R <- exp(delta) R), which is why the pose Jacobian below is
-[R X]_cross and not something involving the current rotation vector.

import numpy as np

# Robustifier scale, in pixels. The same 3.0 px that
# `classical.PNP_REPROJECTION_ERROR_PX` uses to call a correspondence an
# inlier, so a residual this optimiser down-weights is one the pose solve
# would already have rejected. Deliberately not a new number.
HUBER_DELTA_PX = 3.0

# A landmark seen from fewer views than this is dropped: neither adjusted
# nor allowed to constrain a camera.
#
# 2, NOT 3, and the difference is not academic -- it was the single worst
# bug on this branch.
#
# The tempting argument for 3 is about INFORMATION, and it is correct as
# far as it goes: two views determine a point exactly, so a two-view
# landmark can always be moved to make both its residuals zero and it
# tells the optimiser nothing about the cameras. Excluding it saves three
# parameters and loses no information.
#
# It loses CONSISTENCY, which is a different property and the one that
# ships. A third of this map is two-view. Drop those observations and the
# cameras move out from under landmarks that are not allowed to follow,
# so every support row those landmarks already published stops
# reprojecting -- and `support.json` is what cross-segment registration
# solves PnP against. Measured on the drawer walk, adjustment ON,
# identical in every other respect:
#
#     min_views   published reproj median / p99   rows over the 3 px gate
#         3            0.723 / 13.698 px                  9.55%
#         2            0.522 /  2.761 px                  0.57%
#
# The baseline with no adjustment at all is 0.543 / 3.974 px and 1.79%.
# So at 3 the adjustment made the published map markedly WORSE than not
# adjusting at all; at 2 it makes it better on every statistic. That is
# the exact shape this branch exists to avoid -- a trajectory that
# genuinely improved while the artifact everybody consumes got worse --
# and it is visible only if you measure the support table rather than the
# trajectory.

# Cameras whose observations are too few to pose. Below this the camera
# would be moved by noise.
MIN_OBSERVATIONS_PER_CAMERA = 12

# Views of one landmark that may enter the reduced camera system. The
# Schur complement is quadratic in views per landmark, so this bounds a
# worst case; 0 disables it.
#
# 16, and it was 8, and 8 was wrong for THE SAME REASON `min_views = 3`
# was wrong. Both dropped observations from the optimisation while
# leaving the cameras that made them free to move. The landmark then
# stays where it was, the camera does not, and every support row between
# them stops reprojecting -- so the published map degrades while the
# trajectory improves.
#
# MEASURED on the 2026-09-01 long-loop walk, adjustment ON, nothing else
# changed:
#
#   cap    published reproj median / p99   over 3 px   dominant component
#     8          0.726 / 15.800 px            9.51%      7,521 pts (24.1%)
#    16          0.546 /  2.781 px            0.69%     16,340 pts (53.5%)
#
# The baseline with no adjustment at all is 0.587 / 4.732 px, 2.54%, and
# 8,285 points (27.3%). So the cap was not a cost knob at all: at 8 it
# was quietly destroying the artifact the whole pipeline exists to
# produce, and at 16 the same adjustment doubles the dominant component
# AND halves the reprojection tail.
#
# 16 rather than uncapped because uncapped changes the SOLVE: measured
# 194 solved poses against 323, as a stronger adjustment moves poses
# enough to change which later keyframes their PnP can place. The
# dominant component is larger (64.7%) and 129 fewer cameras are posed,
# which is not obviously a better world and is certainly a different
# one. 16 keeps the solve where it was and takes the coherence.
#
# HONESTLY: 16 still violates the invariant above, for the rare landmark
# that exceeds it. A bundle window holds at most BUNDLE_WINDOW = 12
# cameras, so a landmark can only pass 16 ROWS by being claimed twice in
# one frame -- which `_extend` explicitly allows and which the support
# table records as two rows. The cap therefore binds on a small tail
# rather than on ordinary landmarks, which is why 16 measures clean where
# 8 did not. It is a residual risk, not a resolved one, and the right
# eventual fix is to stop publishing two rows for one image point rather
# than to raise this number again.

    # An under-constrained landmark slides along its viewing ray at
    # almost no cost in reprojection -- that is the classic degenerate
    # direction of a bundle problem, and it is exactly what a two-view
    # point has. So the optimiser can leave a point reprojecting
    # beautifully and sitting a hundred metres behind the wall, and the
    # publication gate that would have caught it ran at CREATION time and
    # is not re-run. Measured on the pinned eight-capture corpus, that
    # took the worst bbox blowup -- full extent over the p2-p98 core --
    # from 11.0 to 35.2 while every reprojection statistic improved.
    #
    # So the caller is told which landmarks still pass, on exactly the
    # terms they were admitted by: every observation in front of the
    # camera and within the same `huber_delta` the pose solve used. A
    # landmark with no observations here is reported True and left alone;

    # capture's worst within-segment bbox blowup from 219.1 to 5.1 and
    # left another at 87.4.

    # already applies at creation, derived from the focal length as
