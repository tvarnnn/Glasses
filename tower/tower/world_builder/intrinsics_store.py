"""A resolution-keyed store of camera calibrations on disk.

This module exists because the loop between `calibrate_charuco.py` and
`world_build_session.py` was open. The calibrator's `--out` had no default
location and the builder's `--intrinsics` had no discovery, so the single
working path required an operator to remember a flag on both ends. On
2026-08-24 nobody did -- and could not have, because no calibration
exists -- and the walk produced 155 keyframes, 0 poses and 0 points with
nothing anywhere saying why.

WHERE CALIBRATIONS LIVE, AND WHY

    <world_root>/intrinsics/<width>x<height>.json

Beside `worlds/`, not inside one. A calibration describes the CAMERA, not
a world and not a session: the same glasses build every world on this
Tower, and filing the calibration under the world that happened to be
recording when it was measured would mean the next world starts
uncalibrated again. Worlds are purgeable for privacy (`purge_world`
deletes raw imagery); a calibration contains no imagery and must survive
that.

The resolution is in the FILENAME rather than only inside the record, so
"is there a calibration for this frame size?" is a file-existence
question. A single `intrinsics.json` would have to be opened, parsed, and
then rejected for the wrong resolution -- and the whole failure mode this
guards against is a calibration that loads fine and is silently wrong by
a crop factor. DAT's adaptive ladder changes resolution mid-stream, so
several calibrations coexisting is the expected steady state, not an edge
case.

WHAT THIS STORE REFUSES TO DO

It never rescales. `records.CameraIntrinsics.scaled_to` already refuses
unless `scales_linearly_across_resolutions` is explicitly True, and
whether DAT resizes or crops between its three modes has never been
established. A 480x360 calibration therefore does NOT satisfy a 360x640
lookup. That exact mismatch is already sitting in the 2026-08-24 session
record, which declares 480x360 while every one of its keyframes is
360x640.

A MISS IS NOT AN ERROR

`lookup` returns `CameraIntrinsics.unknown()` for a missing, corrupt,
truncated, mismatched or physically-impossible record. An uncalibrated
Tower must keep working exactly as it does today: honest keyframes, the
unposed backend, no poses. Following `store.WorldStore`'s posture toward
unreadable derived output -- warn and treat as absent -- rather than
raising, because a calibration file is an optional input and a Tower that
refuses to map because one is malformed is worse than one that maps
without poses and says so.
