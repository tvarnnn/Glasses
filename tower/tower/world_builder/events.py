"""The incremental-update stream, as an append-only journal.

An append-only JSONL journal IS an incremental update stream: a reader
tails it and sees each keyframe and each state change as a line, in order.
It needs no socket, no subscription lifecycle, no backpressure policy, and
carries no risk of an unbounded queue.

Deliberately NOT an in-process pub/sub bus. Nothing subscribes in-process
today, because World Builder is not registered as a production module --
the wire contract is scalar-only and the lifecycle work that would change
that is blocked. A bus would be machinery with no consumer. When the
module contract opens up, this journal is what a publisher reads from, and
the events already have stable ids and a closed kind set.

`event_id` is dense within a session on purpose: a gap means an event was
genuinely dropped, not that the writer skipped a number. A consumer can
therefore always tell that it missed something.
