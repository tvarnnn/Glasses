"""On-disk world storage.

Deliberately the same shape as tower/object_memory/store.py: atomic JSON
via temp+fsync+replace inside try/finally, append-only JSONL journals,
raw-dict rewrites, corrupt-line tolerance, and a real purge that removes
every artifact including temp files.

That store was chosen as the model over the numbered-checkpoint/HEAD/mmap
design in the readiness report for a concrete reason. Three Windows
behaviours were verified on this host:

    directory fsync           -> PermissionError [Errno 13]
    replace onto an OPEN dest -> PermissionError [WinError 5]
    unlink an mmap'd file     -> PermissionError [WinError 32]

The checkpoint design needs a validating-recovery path, a fallback policy,
and a retrying garbage collector purely to survive those. Two of the three
do not arise here at all: no directory is renamed and nothing is mmap'd.
The third is already solved by the lock this store inherits. V1 also has
no concurrent reader -- capture, build, and inspect are separate processes
-- so the isolation those subsystems buy has no consumer yet.

Derived output is a single rebuildable directory rather than numbered
checkpoints. Staleness is detected by comparing a digest of the inputs
that produced it, so a stale derived tree is detected rather than trusted.
