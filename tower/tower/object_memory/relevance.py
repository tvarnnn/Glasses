"""What reaches the store, and what is refused, and why.

WHAT THIS REPLACES.

The first slice had two rules: a two-name class whitelist and a
30-second resample window. Both were honest starting points, both said
so in their own comments, and both are now measured -- over all 18,821
real frames rather than the 9,199 that existed when they were written.

  * The whitelist was chosen from a score histogram. A score histogram
    describes the detector's opinion of ITSELF. Reading the actual crops
    found a ceiling fan detected as `airplane` at 0.99 and as `scissors`
    at 0.93, a white door as `refrigerator` at 0.95, a phone in a hand as
    `chair` at 0.94, and a laptop keyboard as `remote` at 0.87. The
    per-class evidence now lives in `classes.py`.
  * The resample window was an interval with no relationship to what the
    camera did: an object glanced at twice in a second produced one
    record and an object watched for four minutes produced eight. It is
    replaced by SIGHTINGS (`sightings.py`), so the unit of memory is an
    event that happened rather than a timer that expired.

FOUR GATES, IN THIS ORDER, AND THE ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING.

  1. EXCLUDED. `person`, and anything else the privacy policy names.
     Checked first so an excluded class can never occupy a slot in any
     table downstream, and so the accounting never reports a refusal
     under the wrong reason.
  2. TIER. What `classes.py` says this class is worth. A class this
     cartridge has no evidence it can read correctly is dropped here,
     before a score is looked at.
  3. SCORE. Weak detections are not evidence.
  4. MATURITY, then VERIFICATION. A sighting must last long enough to be
     real, and a `verify`-tier class must additionally have been agreed
     with by something other than the detector that proposed it.

THE PRIVACY POLICY IS NOT A MODEL'S TO OVERTURN.

Gates 1 and 2 are deterministic tables. A verifier is consulted only at
gate 4, only for classes gate 2 has already admitted, and only to CONFIRM
or REFUSE -- there is no path by which any model introduces a class the
tables did not already allow, and none by which one re-admits `person`.

A TOWER WITH NO VERIFIER BEHAVES AS THE ONE THAT SHIPPED.

With no verifier configured, gate 4 refuses every `verify`-tier class, so
what is written is the `remembered` tier: `laptop` and `cell phone`, the
two classes the corpus supports on the detector's word alone. That is not
a fallback -- it is the same answer the old whitelist gave, now reached
from evidence rather than asserted, with the machinery in place to widen
it the moment something can tell a remote from a keyboard.
