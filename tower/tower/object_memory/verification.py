"""A second opinion on a label, bought once per sighting and never per frame.

WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL.

Reading the crops the shipped detector produced over the real corpus
found that its labels are unreliable for exactly the classes this
cartridge is FOR. A ceiling fan is `airplane` at 0.99 and `scissors` at
0.93. A laptop keyboard is `remote` at 0.87 -- the three highest-scoring
`remote` sightings in 18,821 frames are all keyboards, and the three that
appear to be a real remote all score below 0.68, so the score orders them
exactly wrong. Widening the class whitelist over that detector alone
would fill a wearer's memory with ceiling fans.

So a class the tables consider worth finding, but the detector cannot be
trusted to name, is only written if something else agrees. That is the
whole of this module.

THE RATE, WHICH IS THE POINT.

The validated capture is 186 seconds long and produced 4,287
detections. Nothing here runs on any of them. Verification is asked ONCE
PER SIGHTING, when the sighting matures -- and across the whole
18,821-frame corpus there are 499 sightings of at least three frames, of
which the `verify` tier accounts for **53**. That is one call per 355
frames, or one every 33 seconds of recording, against a detector that
runs about ten times a second.

Measured end to end rather than projected, one run at a time on an idle
host, replaying that capture:

    verifier none    8 observations   103.3 s   46.886 ms/frame
    verifier owlv2  11 observations   112.1 s   50.879 ms/frame
                                      4 calls in 1.0 s of model time

Of the 8.8 extra seconds, **1.0 is inference** and the rest is the
one-off model load. Excluding the load that is +0.45 ms/frame, for three
more memories. The queue never queued: peak depth 0, zero backlog drops.

Every one of those numbers is counted at runtime rather than assumed:
`VerificationQueue` reports submissions, completions, refusals, drops and
the deepest the backlog ever got, and the producer prints them. A funnel
whose narrowing is not measured is a funnel that has quietly stopped
narrowing.

WHAT A VERIFIER MAY AND MAY NOT DO.

It may say "no". It may say "yes, and here is what I think it is". It may
not introduce a class: `RelevanceFilter` consults it only for classes the
deterministic tables have already admitted, and a verdict naming anything
else is recorded as evidence and changes nothing. The privacy policy is
not a model's to overturn, and `person` is not reachable from here by any
path.

ASYNCHRONOUS, AND BOUNDED.

The queue holds a fixed number of pending crops and DROPS THE OLDEST when
it is full. Dropping is the correct failure: an unverified sighting is
simply not written, which is the same outcome as a Tower with no verifier
at all, whereas an unbounded queue on a fifteen-minute walk is a memory
leak with a semantic model attached to it.

# a hand-copied 34-word list while `verifier_vocabulary()` returned 31,
# so its figures described a configuration that does not ship; the bench
# now imports the list. Re-running changed nothing but llmdet's latency.
#
# The gap is architectural rather than incidental. OWLv2 embeds each
# prompt SEPARATELY and scores it against the image's object queries, so
# a vocabulary of thirty-one names produces thirty-one scores and the
# question "did the proposed label come first" has an answer. LLMDet is
# phrase grounding: the vocabulary is joined into one sentence and what
# comes back is TEXT SPANS -- "a set", "a pair", "a" -- which have to be
# mapped back onto class names by string matching. It also pays for that
# sentence, at 3.1 seconds a crop against 126 milliseconds, because
# cross-attention scales with text length.

# A model that answers a different question well is not the better model

# WHAT IT DOES NOT FIX. Every one of its false rejects is a crop of 5.3%
# of the frame or smaller -- three real remotes at 3.7-3.9%, called
# `computer mouse` and `cell phone`. The size floor the shipped detector
# has is not removed by a second opinion; it moves one stage later. On
# 360x640 source imagery that is a property of the pixels, and the fixes
# are upstream: a higher capture resolution, or tiled detection on the
# async path.
