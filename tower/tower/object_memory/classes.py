"""Which COCO classes this cartridge may remember, and why each one.

THE MEASUREMENT THAT DECIDED THIS FILE.

The previous policy was a two-name tuple, `("laptop", "cell phone")`,
chosen from a score histogram over the real corpus. A score histogram
describes the DETECTOR'S OPINION OF ITSELF. It cannot say whether a
label is correct, because `data/captures/` carries no annotation and
nothing in this repository had ever looked at a crop.

So on 2026-08-27 the crops were looked at. Every detection
`ssdlite320_mobilenet_v3_large` makes over all 18,821 real frames was
dumped (`scripts/research/object_memory_corpus_dump.py`), grouped into
temporally contiguous SIGHTINGS, and the strongest frame of each sighting
was cropped onto a contact sheet
(`scripts/research/sighting_contact_sheet.py`) and read by eye. The
per-class results are in the table below and in
`docs/superpowers/research/2026-08-27-object-memory-corpus-precision.md`.

Two findings govern everything here.

**1. Score does not order correctness ACROSS classes.** A ceiling fan in
this home is detected as `airplane` at 0.99 and as `scissors` at 0.93 --
seven and four sightings respectively, none of them an aeroplane or a
pair of scissors. A white door is `refrigerator` at 0.95. A phone held in
a hand is `chair` at 0.94. A laptop keyboard is `remote` at 0.87. Every
one of those is above the 0.5 the old policy used as its bar, and above
the 0.813 median that justified admitting `laptop`.

**2. The classes a person actually loses are the ones COCO cannot
name.** Keys, a wallet and a pair of glasses have no COCO class at all.
The ones that do exist -- `remote`, `backpack`, `handbag`, `book`,
`bottle` -- produced 8, 1, 0, 1 and 2 sightings across the whole corpus,
and inspection found `backpack` to be a closet of hanging clothes and
`book` to be a laptop screen.

Together those say something specific: **widening the whitelist over this
detector alone would fill a wearer's memory with ceiling fans.** The
class list is therefore not a list of what may be remembered. It is a
list of what may be remembered WITHOUT a second opinion, plus a list of
what may be remembered WITH one -- and the second opinion is a separate,
optional stage that a Tower without a semantic model simply does not
have, in which case those classes are not remembered at all.

THE PRIVACY DECISION IS NOT IN THE TABLE.

`person` is EXCLUDED, and the exclusion is not a tier -- it is a
different kind of entry, in a different constant, checked first, and it
is the one thing no model may overturn. Whether Object Memory may
persist a record per detected bystander is a genuinely open ruling. The
corpus reframes it without answering it: `person` boxes on this footage
have a median area of 38.7% of the frame at the 0.5 threshold this file
uses (35.4% if every detection down to 0.15 is counted) and are usually
the wearer's own torso seen while looking down, so a `person` record
here would mostly be
the wearer -- simultaneously less sensitive than feared and far less
useful than hoped. Real bystanders will appear eventually and the ruling
will still be needed. Leaving `person` out is what lets this cartridge
ship without it, and adding it back is not a tuning change.

WHAT THIS CORPUS CANNOT SAY.

34 captures from ONE home, overwhelmingly one activity: a person using a
laptop in a bedroom. `laptop` at 24 correct crops out of 24 is a strong
statement about this laptop in this room, and a weak one about laptops.
No kitchen drawer, no car, no office, no bystander, no set of keys was
ever recorded. Every figure here is a lower bound on how wrong a class
can be, never an upper bound.

# -- the tiers ---------------------------------------------------------
#
# A tier is a decision about EVIDENCE, not about importance. What a class
# is worth remembering is a separate axis and lives in `WORTH_FINDING`
# below, because the two questions come apart: `bed` is detected
# reliably and is not a thing anybody looks for, and `remote` is the
# opposite.

# Remembered on the detector's word alone. Reserved for classes whose
# labels were checked by eye and found right, in this corpus.
REMEMBERED = "remembered"

# Remembered ONLY if a second opinion agrees. These are classes worth
# finding whose labels this detector gets wrong often enough that the
# memory would be worse than empty. With no verifier configured, nothing
# in this tier is ever written -- which is exactly the behaviour that
# shipped, and is why turning a verifier off is safe rather than
# silently lossy.
VERIFY = "verify"

# Detected, often correctly, and not a memory. Furniture and fittings
# say WHERE somebody was, which is a live question about the current
# scene and belongs to Scene Understanding -- a cartridge that already
# exists and already holds it, without persisting anything. Duplicating
# it here would put a permanent record of a wearer's furniture on disk
# to answer a question another module answers for free.
