# --- What the privacy tags on a record mean -------------------------------
#
# DERIVED_ONLY is a claim about the record's CONTENT: a class label, a
# score and a box, with no pixels, no crop and no embedding of the frame.
# That much was always true.
#
# It was read as a claim about REACH, and there it was false.
# `session_id` + `frame_seq` is an exact pointer into
# `data/captures/<session_id>/frames/`, where the JPEG this record was
# derived from is still sitting. Object Memory's retention governs THIS
# store and nothing else: purging every observation here leaves the
# imagery untouched, and any record that survives resolves straight back
# to a frame.
#
# The provenance is worth keeping -- it is what makes a record checkable
# against the footage instead of merely believable. So the fix is to stop
# the tag overclaiming rather than to drop the fields: a record that
# carries a frame pointer says FRAME_REFERENCED as well, so a reader can
# see that its privacy footprint is bounded by capture-side retention and
# not by ours.

    Needed because a record has to be ADDRESSABLE: `GET
    /object-memory/observations/{id}/frame` cannot exist without one, and
    "the laptop record whose observed_at is 1787806912.4471" is not a URL.

    DERIVED, not a uuid4, and that is the whole design. Sixty-four
    observations are already on disk, written before this field existed.
    A random id would have to be minted at read time -- so it would
    change on every read, and a link to a record would stop working the
    moment the Tower restarted -- or written back, which means rewriting
    a wearer's memory to add a field. Deriving it from the three values
    that already identify a sighting gives every existing record a
    permanent id it never had, with no migration and no write.

    The inputs are exactly the ones `ObservationStore.update_sighting`
    matches on, so an id and an update can never disagree about which
    record they mean.

    Truncated to 16 hex characters. This is a handle within one store,
    not a global identifier: 64 bits is far more than enough to keep a
    few thousand records apart, and a shorter string is a friendlier URL.

    """One "this category was visible at this time" record.

    Deliberately NOT a claim that the object is present now, or that it is
    a specific instance ("my keys" vs "keys"). See 07-PLATFORM-CONSTRAINTS.md
    Core Principle 3 and OBJECT-MEMORY.md's Identity vs. Category section.

    observed_at is qualified by time_basis: this slice can only know
    tower-receipt time, never on-glasses capture time (Rule 16 -- these
    must not be conflated). There is no soft-delete flag by design;
    06-PRIVACY-DATA.md requires real deletion.

    spatial_ref and external_refs are reserved-but-unused: they are carried
    so a later cross-module need does not require rewriting already-persisted
    records (see 2026-08-20-canonical-memory-architecture.md).

    THREE FIELDS ABOUT STRENGTH, AND WHICH TO TRUST FOR WHAT.

    detector_score is PROVENANCE: how confident the detector was in the
    frame that FIRST brought this class into view -- the one frame this
    record's observed_at, frame_seq and bounding_box all describe. It is
    what makes the record auditable, and it never moves.

    best_score is EVIDENCE: the strongest score seen while that same
    sighting stayed in view, filled in afterwards by the producer as the
    sighting continues. Also never revised downwards.

    confidence is the INTERPRETATION, and it is the field a consumer
    reads. The claim a record makes is "this category was in view", so it
    is derived from best_score -- the best evidence for that claim --
    and moves with it. A record first seen at 0.601 and then seen at
    0.962 is a HIGH-confidence record about a laptop, with 0.601 still on
    it saying how the sighting started. At the first write the two scores
    are equal, so the initial label is derived from either.

    None of the three is a calibrated probability. They are detector
    output, and an interpretation of detector output.
