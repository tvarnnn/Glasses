"""This cartridge's detector: the shared one, configured for a memory.

The seam and the fake used to live here in full. They now live in
`tower/detection.py`, promoted once a third consumer of the same weights
appeared -- the outcome
`test_object_memory_does_not_import_the_experimental_cv_lab` named in its
own docstring, and the same move `tower/confidence.py` made when a second
module wanted the same four labels. What is left in this file is the part
that is genuinely about Object Memory.

**The seam still exists, for the reasons it always did.** The real
detector costs a model download that a default test suite must not pay
for, and the fake lets the producer be tested against detections a test
wrote down rather than against whatever torchvision happened to find.

**Still not the Experimental CV Lab.** `experiments/object_detection.py`
loads these exact weights and measured them (38.6 ms median on CUDA
across the real 9,199-frame corpus), but it reports COUNTS and a memory
needs the individual detection. Sharing a platform module with Scene
Understanding is not the same as importing a sandbox: shared code is
code the platform maintains, a sandbox is code that may be thrown away,
and nothing that may be thrown away belongs upstream of a persistent
store.

**Nothing here reaches another cartridge.** The shared detector holds no
state and no model, so a detector that cannot load fails for THIS
producer and no other -- which is what lets the engine keep reporting its
refusals honestly instead of inheriting somebody else's failure.

Everything here is **model inference, not measured fact**
(`07-PLATFORM-CONSTRAINTS.md` Core Principle 2). A detection is evidence
that something scored above a threshold, and nothing more.

    """The shared SSDLite detector, with this cartridge's two choices.

    **No class filter.** A memory of what was around cannot pre-judge
    which categories will turn out to matter, so every COCO class the
    model reports is offered to the relevance filter, which applies its
    own higher `min_score` and its own `PERSISTED_CLASSES` downstream.
    Scene Understanding narrows at the detector instead, because a live
    state cluttered with ninety-one classes buries the answer. The
    difference is the reason the class list is a parameter rather than a
    constant in shared code.

    **Its own weights.** Subclassing binds defaults; it does not share a
    model with anyone. Two cartridges running at once load 13.4 MB twice,
    which is cheaper than the failure mode a shared residency would
    introduce.
