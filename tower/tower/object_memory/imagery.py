"""Resolving a record back to the picture it was derived from.

WHY THIS IS WORTH BUILDING, AND IT IS NOT OBVIOUS.

The strongest published evidence on wearable memory aids says the IMAGE
is the product and the label is not. MemPal (15 adults aged 62-96, in
their own homes, objects hidden and retrieved after a 40-minute delay)
measured its own answers as correct only 72% of the time in audio form
and its last-seen images as showing the true location only 53% of the
time -- and users still went from 0.81 to 0.95-0.97 retrieval accuracy,
searching 1.1 rooms instead of 1.9. A wrong-but-plausible cue plus a
human closes the gap. A confident sentence does not.

This cartridge already had the pointer: every record carries a capture
id, a frame number and a box. What it had was a DIAGNOSTIC -- the iOS
surface renders it as "Frame reference: capture 22e9d428..., frame 3410"
inside a disclosure -- which is a correct thing to show a developer and
close to useless to a wearer. This module is what turns the pointer into
the picture.

IT IS A DISPLAY FILTER, NOT A PRIVACY TRANSFORMATION, AND IT SAYS SO.

`tower/world_builder/redaction.py` makes exactly this distinction and is
right: redacting on the way out leaves the raw frames on disk, where a
later bug, a backup or a forensic recovery can still reach them. That
module runs BEFORE persistence, at the one choke point every persisted
pixel passes through, and it earns the name privacy transformation.

Object Memory has no such choke point over the CAPTURE. It serves frames
out of `data/captures/`, which it does not own, did not write, and must
not modify -- the manifests there record `redaction: "none"` and
rewriting them would destroy the corpus every measurement in this
repository is made against. So what happens here is a filter applied on
READ, the raw frame stays exactly where it was, and the label says
`display-filter/...` rather than anything that could be read as "this
image is safe".

WHERE THAT IS NO LONGER THE WHOLE STORY.

Since `keyframes.py`, this cartridge does own one small picture per
record: a filtered crop written under the OBSERVATION root, so a 30-day
memory stops depending on a capture directory nobody promised to keep.
That store DOES have a choke point -- `KeyframeStore.write` is the only
way a pixel gets in, and it is arranged so that the bytes written are
always the filter's output -- and it is still not called a privacy
transformation, for the same reason as everything else here: YuNet's
blind spots do not close because a file was written instead of served.

The consequence for this module is one asymmetry, in `render`. A CROP
prefers the owned keyframe and is served from it WITHOUT being filtered
again, because it was filtered before it reached disk, which is the
stronger of the two guarantees. A whole FRAME still comes from the
capture and is still filtered on read -- a keyframe is a crop, and there
is nothing to build a context view out of.

WHY THE CODE IS DUPLICATED RATHER THAN SHARED.

`tower/detection.py` records the rule this follows: shared code was
promoted when a THIRD consumer appeared, and until then "the duplication
was the honest answer and two boundary tests said so in their own
docstrings". There are two consumers of YuNet now. A cartridge may not
import another cartridge (`test_a_cartridge_does_not_import_another_
cartridge` is symmetric and exhaustive), and World Builder is frozen to
another lane, so promoting its file is not this lane's to do.

The constants below are World Builder's, measured by it, and they are
copied deliberately rather than tuned: two copies that disagree about a
face-detection threshold would be worse than two copies that agree. The
promotion trigger -- a third consumer -- is recorded in
`docs/agent-handoffs/OBJECT-MEMORY-MAC-HANDOFF.md`.

WHAT MAY BE CLAIMED.

Not "faces removed". YuNet has measured hard false negatives: a face
occluded more than about 60%, and a face rotated about 90 degrees in
plane. Profile and rear views are a known blind spot of this detector
class. So the label records WHAT RAN -- the detector's identity and its
threshold -- and never "redacted", "anonymised" or "privacy-safe".
Bodies, clothing, room contents, screens and any undetected face are all
still in the picture.

AND IF THE FILTER CANNOT RUN, NOTHING IS SERVED.

This is a NEW surface exposing pixels that were previously only pointed
at. A missing model means the honest answer is a refusal, not a raw
first-person frame with an apologetic header on it.

# capture directory still existed and nothing had expired -- this repo has
# no capture pruner at all, so nothing CAN expire. The route was answering
# 410 "the memory is kept, the picture is gone" about pictures that were
