"""`GET /cv-lab` -- the Lab's status document, over HTTP.

The same object the socket serves, from the same function, for the same
reason `GET /cartridges` exists beside `{"type": "cartridges"}`: a
capability you can only learn by opening a socket cannot be checked
before you open one, and this is the surface an operator reaches with
`curl` from the machine they are actually sitting at. The Tower is
normally driven over Tailscale, where a server-side log line is invisible.

Read-only, and there is deliberately no HTTP surface for start, pause or
stop. A command needs the connection it is issued on to still be there
when the outcome arrives -- a start may take two minutes to arm -- and a
request/response route would have to either block for that or lie about
having finished. The socket already carries the state that answers it.

A test asserts this route and the socket's `cv_lab_status` reply carry
the same document. Two surfaces onto one function, never two functions
that agree today.
