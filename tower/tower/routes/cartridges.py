"""`GET /cartridges` -- the capability declaration, over HTTP.

HTTP rather than only a WebSocket message, because of the third state in
`IOS-to-Tower.md` 0.1: "the Tower offers a contract this build
implements, but is **unreachable** -> 'connect'". A client that can only
learn the contract set by opening the socket cannot distinguish that
state from "not built yet" -- it would have to be connected to find out
whether it should be connected.

The declaration is also the thing iOS CACHES ("iOS caches a declaration
rather than fetching a registry"), and a cacheable thing wants a plain
GET.

The same declaration is available on the socket as `{"type":
"cartridges"}`. Both call `registry.declare()`, and a test asserts the
two are byte-identical -- two surfaces onto one function, never two
functions that agree today.
