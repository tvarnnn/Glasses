"""The live scene, and the switch that turns it on. Over HTTP.

Named after the QUESTION rather than the cartridge, exactly as
`geometry.py` and `observations.py` are: a route file named after the
cartridge would put its name into `main.py`'s import list, which is the
boundary two tests exist to hold.

WHY A CONTROL SURFACE EXISTS AT ALL, GIVEN THE PHONE SENDS NOTHING

`IOS-to-Tower.md` 6.2 is explicit that opening a cartridge on the phone
sends **nothing** -- "a test asserts the wire stays silent" -- so the
phone cannot be the thing that starts a session. Two other consumers can,
and both are real:

  * a Mac operator, or curl, driving a physical test. Somebody has to be
    able to start a session, walk into a room and read the counts back,
    and that has to be possible before any Swift exists.
  * this Tower's own result channel, on a subscription. A client that
    subscribes wants a scene; starting on demand is the same rule the
    result hub already applies to itself -- "a Tower nobody is watching
    does no polling and no disk IO on its behalf".

Both drive the same session object through the same verbs, so there is
one state machine and not two.

WHY GET /scene DUPLICATES THE SOCKET PAYLOAD

It is the identical function -- `live_payload` -- so the two cannot
disagree, which is the same arrangement `/cartridges` has with
`{"type": "cartridges"}`. Having it on HTTP is what makes the cartridge
physically testable by a person with a browser and no WebSocket client.

Every handler is `def` rather than `async def` on purpose. FastAPI runs a
sync endpoint in its threadpool, so `stop()`'s bounded join on a worker
thread happens there and not on the event loop -- the same reason
`geometry.py` and `observations.py` give for the same choice.

NOTHING HERE OBSERVES A FRAME.

The session is fed by `tower/routes/ws.py`, from the connection that
receives frames. This module can start it, pause it, stop it and read it.
It cannot hand it a frame, and there is no code path here that could.
