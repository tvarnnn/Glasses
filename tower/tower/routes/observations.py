"""Object Memory's observations, over HTTP. Read-only.

Named after the question rather than the cartridge, exactly as
`geometry.py` is: a route file called `object_memory.py` would put a
cartridge's name into `main.py`'s import list, which is the boundary
`test_shared_code_does_not_import_a_cartridge` exists to hold. The
cartridge is reached only through `tower/results/object_memory.py`, the
adapter named after it.

Both handlers are declared `def` rather than `async def` on purpose.
FastAPI runs a sync endpoint in its threadpool, which keeps the JSONL
read off the event loop with no executor of our own -- the same reason
`tower/routes/geometry.py` gives for the same choice. An `async def`
here would block the frame path behind a disk read.

NOTHING HERE MUTATES.

`ObservationStore` can purge and can prune. This module reaches neither,
and `test_no_wire_module_can_reach_purge_or_prune` fails if it ever
does. Deletion stays with `scripts/object_query.py --purge-all`, where a
human types it.

THE IMAGERY ROUTES SERVE PIXELS, AND THAT IS NEW.

Until now this cartridge exposed a POINTER to a frame and never the
frame. Three rules hold that step:

  * every picture passes a face filter on the way out, and a Tower whose
    filter cannot run serves NOTHING rather than an unfiltered
    first-person frame;
  * the label says `display-filter/...`, because the stored frame is
    unchanged and calling this a privacy transformation would be false;
  * a record whose imagery has aged out answers "the memory is kept and
    the picture is not", which is the whole reason the shape exists.

`Cache-Control: no-store` on both binary routes. This is sensitive
first-person imagery on a LAN-local origin, and a proxy or a browser
holding a copy is a second store nobody chose.

RETENTION IS NARROWABLE, NEVER WIDENABLE.

`retention_days` is a request, not an authority. It travels into the
store, which clamps every read to min(persisted, requested). A caller
asking for 3650 days against a store written under the 30-day default
still gets 30 days, and the response says so in `retention.clamped`
rather than pretending the question was honoured. The clamp is the
store's, not this route's -- this file consumes the property and adds
nothing of its own that could weaken it.
