"""The WebSocket half of the cartridge result channel.

Kept out of `ws.py` on purpose. That module owns the frame path -- the
latency-measured, privacy-sensitive part of this system -- and the result
channel is a side surface that must be able to fail without implicating
it. Separate module, separate failure domain, and `ws.py` gains four small
dispatch branches rather than three hundred lines.

Every handler here returns without raising. A malformed subscribe, an
unknown cartridge, a hostile payload: all become a `result_error` on the
wire. The receive loop must never learn that the result channel had a
problem, because the receive loop is what answers frames.
