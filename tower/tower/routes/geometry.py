"""World Builder geometry, over HTTP.

HTTP and not the WebSocket, for a reason that is in the code rather than
in taste: `tower/routes/ws.py` gives the result sender and the frame path
one shared `asyncio.Lock`. One session's `points.json` is 1.07 MB against
a 3,884-byte status snapshot, so pushing geometry down that socket would
hold the lock and starve `frame_result` -- the exact thing
`CARTRIDGE-RESULTS.md` forbids in Tower responsibility #3.

Both handlers are declared `def` rather than `async def` on purpose.
FastAPI runs a sync endpoint in its threadpool, which keeps the disk read
and the hash off the event loop with no executor of our own.
