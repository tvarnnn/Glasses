"""What this Tower has read, over HTTP. Read-only, plus a Start/Stop.

Named after the question rather than the cartridge, exactly as
`geometry.py` and `observations.py` are: a route file named after the
cartridge would put its name into `main.py`'s import list and into
`main.py`'s raw text, which two tests forbid.

WHY HTTP AND NOT THE RESULT SOCKET

`tower/routes/ws.py` gives the result sender and the frame path one
shared `asyncio.Lock`, so a large result send directly delays the next
`frame_result`. Document text is the largest thing this platform could
put on that socket and the most sensitive: `IOS-to-Tower.md` 3.2 already
requires that "the list carries a character count, not the text... Full
text is fetched when a person opens one", which is the manifest/segment
split World Builder's geometry uses, arrived at from the privacy side
rather than the size side.

So: the LIST is here and carries no text. ONE DOCUMENT is here and
carries its pages. The session's progress is on the result channel, where
a push is worth having.

Every handler is `def` rather than `async def` on purpose. FastAPI runs a
sync endpoint in its threadpool, which keeps a full journal parse off the
event loop with no executor of our own -- the same reason
`observations.py` gives for the same choice.

NOTHING HERE MUTATES A STORED DOCUMENT.

`DocumentStore` can `purge()` and `prune_expired()`. Neither is reachable
from this module and neither may become reachable: an unauthenticated
HTTP endpoint that erases what a wearer read is not a feature, and
06-PRIVACY-DATA.md's real deletion stays where a human types it --
`scripts/document_query.py --purge`.

The Start/Stop handlers below control a CAPTURE SESSION, which is a
different thing: they decide whether this Tower is currently looking for
documents. They cannot delete one, cannot change retention, and cannot
reach the store at all.
