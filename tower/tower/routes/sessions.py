"""Start, Pause and Stop for a cartridge, over HTTP.

**The first mutating surface in this Tower, and the smallest one that
closes the gap.** Everything else here is a `GET` or a socket
subscription, because until now nothing a wearer could press existed:
producers were started by a human typing a command against a capture id
copied out of a directory listing. That is not a product, and it was
measured as not being one -- the 2026-08-26 physical run remembered 64
observations and every one of them required a second terminal.

**Cartridge-blind.** This module imports no cartridge and names none. It
looks a session up by the cartridge id in the path and asks it to apply
an action; `main.py` decides which cartridges have sessions at all. A
Tower that runs none answers 404 here for every id, which is a claim
about configuration and not about the request.

**Why `POST` and not a socket message.** The socket carries frames, and
its send lock is shared with the frame path -- the same reason
`tower/routes/geometry.py` exists as HTTP. A Pause that had to queue
behind a frame send would be a Pause that arrives late, and the whole
point of the control is that it is obeyed when pressed.

**Why sync `def`.** `detach` waits up to `DETACH_GRACE_SECONDS` for a
producer to finish its current record before terminating it. On the
event loop that would stall every frame on the Tower for five seconds.
FastAPI runs a sync endpoint in its threadpool, which is where a call
that can block belongs, and
`test_the_session_handlers_are_sync_so_a_pause_cannot_stall_the_frame_path`
pins it because it is the whole mechanism.

**Refusals are 409, not 200.** `GET /object-memory/last-seen/teapot`
answers 200 with `observed: false` because a 404 there would be a claim
about the world. This is the opposite situation: an action that could not
be honoured is not a fact about anything, and a client that ignored the
body would read 200 as "paused". A status code a client cannot ignore is
the right shape for a control surface, and the body still carries the
reason and the state that was actually reached.
