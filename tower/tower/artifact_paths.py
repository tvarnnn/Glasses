"""Where Tower is allowed to put the artifacts it writes.

This exists because of a specific, repeated, measured failure -- not as a
general-purpose path utility.

Two independent mechanisms have put Glasses data outside every Glasses
directory on this host:

1.  **A relative root resolved from the wrong place.** Every session CLI
    below takes ``--root`` and defaults it to a *relative* path
    (``data/world_builder``). Relative to what is decided by whatever
    directory the caller happened to be standing in. An agent working
    from ``C:\\`` with ``--root wbr3`` gets ``C:\\wbr3``, silently, with no
    error -- and that is exactly the shape of the run roots that were
    found at the drive root (``C:\\wbr3``, ``C:\\wbr4``, ``C:\\wbrev`` ...).

2.  **MAX_PATH pressure.** Windows' 260-character path limit makes deep
    project paths genuinely fail; ``tower/docs/superpowers/research/
    2026-08-26-slam-lane-learned-3d.md`` records a clone dying with
    ``Filename too long`` and being "worked around by cloning to
    ``C:\\m3s``". The workaround is real. The drive root is not the right
    place to put it.

The fix is not to guess a directory for the caller. It is to refuse the two
placements that are never correct and say why, at the CLI boundary, where
the mistake is actually made and can still be corrected by hand.

Refused:

* a filesystem root itself (``C:\\``, ``/``)
* a direct child of a filesystem root (``C:\\wbmut``, ``C:\\wb-stage0``)
* the user's home directory itself
* a direct child of the user's home directory (``~/wbscratch``)

Everything else is allowed. In particular a temp directory
(``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Temp\\<something>\\...``) is deep inside the home
directory, not a direct child of it, so ordinary ``tempfile`` use is
untouched -- tests and smoke runs keep working.

See ``CLAUDE.md`` ("Glasses filesystem / worktree policy") for where
artifacts are supposed to go instead.
