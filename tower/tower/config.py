    #
    # THE DEFAULT REVERSED, AND THE REASON MATTERS.
    #
    # This used to default to None on the grounds that "a memory of what
    # a wearer's camera saw does not go on the network because a process
    # happened to start in a directory that has one". The physical test
    # on 2026-08-26 showed what that actually bought: the producer wrote
    # 64 observations to `data/object_memory` regardless, and the only
    # thing the unset default prevented was the WEARER reading their own
    # memory back. Data existed, nothing served it, and no log line said
    # why. A default that hides data from its owner while still storing
    # it protects nobody.
    #
    # So the switch moved to where the decision actually is:
    # `observation_enabled` governs whether this Tower produces or serves

    # "cpu" by default, and the reason is CONTENTION rather than speed --

    # CUDA was slower and cited a figure that was not a measurement.
    #
    # It said "a CUDA pass over the whole corpus measured a WORSE 75
    # ms/frame mean". 75.0 was the running average printed at frame
    # 10,000 of a run competing with a test suite; the run's actual mean
    # was 87.8, and neither number describes a quiet host.
    #
    # Re-measured with no other work of ours running, replaying the same
    # 2,203-frame capture: CPU **39.8 to 46.9 ms/frame** across five
    # consecutive runs, against CUDA at 48.7. An independent audit on the
    # same host measured the ordering the OTHER WAY (CUDA 43.9 against
    # CPU 51.0). The spread within one device exceeds the gap between
    # them, so the honest statement is that this detector costs about the
    # same either way -- the work is single-frame preprocessing and
    # transfer, not the 320x320 forward pass, and neither device is doing
    # much of it.
    #
    # THIS HOST IS NOT QUIET. It carries several autonomous agent lanes
    # at once, and two more appeared in `git worktree list` while these
    # numbers were being taken. Read every latency figure in this
    # cartridge as a range.
    #
    # What is NOT within noise is what else wants the GPU. Object Memory
    # does not own this Tower: World Builder runs on it, the depth
    # experiment runs on it, and this cartridge's own verifier takes
    # 620 MB of VRAM when it is enabled. A producer that follows a
    # capture has no latency requirement at all -- it may fall behind and
    # catch up -- so it is the one stage that should stay off the
    # contended device.

    # fan detected as `airplane` at 0.99 and a laptop keyboard as
    # `remote` at 0.87, so a Tower with nothing to check those labels
    # recorded neither -- and `docs/agent-handoffs/OBJECT-MEMORY-HANDOFF`
    # section 7.4 recorded turning it on as an OPEN DECISION FOR A HUMAN,
    # explicitly not one an agent should close: "the default stays `none`
    # because 94 crops from one home justify building it and not
    # switching it on for everybody."
    #
    # A human closed it. The 2026-08-29 product pass was instructed that
    # OWLv2 is this project's intended standard configuration and that
    # setting `TOWER_OBSERVATION_VERIFIER` by hand before every launch is
    # not acceptable for ordinary use. That is the ruling section 7.4 was
    # waiting for, and it is recorded here rather than in a shell script
    # so that every way of starting this Tower agrees.
    #
    # WHAT IT COSTS, AND WHY IT IS STILL SAFE TO DEFAULT.
    #
    # ~600 MB of weights, fetched once, and ~620 MB of VRAM while the
    # producer runs. A host that cannot get the weights is NOT broken by
    # this: `_build_verifier` reports the failure and runs with no
    # verifier, which narrows what is recorded to the two classes the
    # detector is trusted on. The narrowing direction is the only one
    # this setting is allowed to fail in.
    #
    # It changes what this Tower RECORDS, from two classes to fourteen.
    #
    # `recorded_classes` on the read routes is derived from this value --
    # and that means it reports what was ASKED FOR, not what loaded. The
    # web process cannot know the difference: the weights are loaded in
    # the producer, in another process, minutes later, and there is no
    # channel back. So on a host where the download fails, the routes
    # advertise fourteen classes while the producer records two, and the
    # only place that says so is the producer's own report
    # (`verifier` beside `verifier_requested`) and the loud line it
    # prints on stderr into the Tower console.
    #
    # Documented rather than papered over. Inventing a channel for it
    # would put cartridge state on the web process for a case that is
    # loud and one-off, and a client that needs certainty should read the
    # report.
    #
    # A NAME rather than a boolean, because the answer will eventually be
    # a model identifier and a boolean cannot become one. It is handed to
    # the producer's argv AND used by the read routes to say which
    # classes this Tower records, so the two cannot disagree about it.

    # asymmetry is the measurement: the detector costs about the same on
    # either device (within noise, see above), while the verifier
    # measured 126 ms a crop on this GPU against 2,473 ms on this CPU --
    # a factor of nineteen. Splitting the two stages across devices is
    # what keeps a 2.5-second burst off the cores the detector is using,
    # and it costs 620 MB of VRAM on a card that has twelve.
    #
    # A host with no CUDA does not need this set: the verifier reports
    # the downgrade and runs on CPU rather than failing. Since 2026-08-29
    # the default says so explicitly -- "auto" rather than "cuda" -- so

    # WHAT IT FIXES. A record has 30-day retention. The picture it points
    # at lives in `data/captures/<session_id>/frames/`, which this
    # cartridge does not own and whose lifetime it does not set -- which
    # is why every record carries `frame-referenced` and every imagery
    # payload said `imagery_retention: "capture-side"`. Today nothing
    # prunes captures at all (`CaptureRecorder.purge()` has no production
    # caller), so nothing has gone wrong yet. The first thing that prunes
    # them -- a capture pruner, or a human reclaiming the ~2.1 GB an hour
    # a recording costs -- takes the picture out of EVERY memory at once,
    # and a memory aid whose measured product value is the image becomes
    # a label and a timestamp. With this on, the record keeps a crop this
    # cartridge owns and this cartridge's retention deletes.
    #
    # WHAT IT COSTS. MEASURED over all 116 of this host's records: mean 11.7 KB
    # a keyframe (median 12.3, max 22.1) at a 384 px long side and JPEG
    # quality 80, so about 4.3 MB an hour of walking at the corpus's
    # measured rate of ~380 records an hour -- roughly 1/400th of what
    # the recording itself costs. On the frame path it costs one padded
    # numpy copy per admitted detection; the write itself happens once
    # per sighting, at its end, off the frame path.
    #
    # WHAT IT REQUIRES, AND WHAT HAPPENS WITHOUT IT. A face-detection
    # model. `KeyframeStore.write` FAILS CLOSED: with no weights, or a
    # filter that raises, it writes nothing at all rather than writing an
    # unfiltered crop with an honest label on it -- a label is not a
    # control and a file outlives every label that travelled with it. So
    # a Tower with no model keeps behaving exactly as it did, serves
    # crops out of the capture as before, and says so once, loudly, at
    # producer start rather than refusing silently a few hundred times.
    #
    # OFF is a real configuration and not a degraded one: it reproduces

    #
    # The CV Lab's `process()` runs SYNCHRONOUSLY ON THE EVENT LOOP, so
