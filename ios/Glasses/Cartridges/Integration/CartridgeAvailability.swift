/// revision of that agreement it is offering.

/// ## What this deliberately does not decide
///
/// The Tower's contracts do not exist yet. Every field below is therefore
/// **opaque to this app**: the identifier is a token the Tower chooses and iOS
/// only ever compares for equality, never parses, orders, or ranges over.
///
/// That opacity is the point. A `version: Int` with a `>=` comparison would
/// have baked in three assumptions the Tower has not agreed to — that contracts
/// are versioned by integer, that versions are totally ordered, and that a
/// newer Tower contract is backward compatible with an older client. All three
/// are plausible and none is ours to decide. Equality against a set of
/// identifiers this build was written against assumes only that the Tower can
/// name the thing it is offering, which any contract scheme must do.
///
/// **There is no wire format here.** No message name, no route, no key. This
/// says only "if and when the Tower tells us which contract it speaks, this is
/// the shape of the answer we will hold onto".

/// Why a cartridge's Tower backing is, or is not, usable right now.
///
/// Five cartridges need this and they need exactly the same four answers, which
/// is what justifies it being shared rather than restated per cartridge. Four of
/// them reach it through `resolve(declared:supported:isTowerReachable:)` below,
/// so the ordering of the checks — which failure wins when several apply — is
/// decided once instead of five times. Object Memory is the fifth and projects
/// its own learned state onto these cases directly, because its contract is not
/// declared in advance and `.unprobed` is a state none of the four can express;
/// it follows the same precedence deliberately, and says so where it does.
enum CartridgeAvailability: Equatable, Sendable {
    /// The Tower has not declared a contract for this cartridge at all.

    /// This was once the answer for every cartridge. It no longer is: a live
    /// Tower declares `world_builder.status/2026-08-25` over `GET /cartridges`,

    /// Builder resolves past this case.

    /// **The roadmap framing this comment used to carry is now wrong and has

    /// Understanding under `not_offered`. As of 2026-08-27 the Tower declares
    /// four contracts and `not_offered` is `[]`.
