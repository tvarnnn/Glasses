/// inferred rather than measured.
///
/// These are not a convenience layer. `docs/02-DEVELOPMENT-RULES.md` Rule 16
/// and `docs/07-PLATFORM-CONSTRAINTS.md` make them obligations:
///
/// > **2. Inference ≠ Measurement.** ML-derived depth, object identity,
/// > semantic interpretation, and similar outputs must not be represented as
/// > equivalent to directly measured sensor values.
///
/// > **4. Confidence Must Survive the Pipeline.** Where an observation
/// > originates from probabilistic inference, uncertainty/confidence must not
/// > disappear simply because the observation is persisted, transmitted, fused,
/// > or consumed by another module.
///
/// This layer is the last link in that pipeline, and the easiest place for
/// confidence to disappear: a view can always choose not to draw a number it
/// was given. Encoding provenance *in the type* is what makes that omission a
/// deliberate act rather than an oversight — there is no way to hold a value
/// here without also holding where it came from.

// MARK: - Scale

/// How a spatial figure was arrived at.
///
/// **Moved here from `Workspaces/WorldBuilder/WorldModel.swift` unchanged.**
/// Nothing about it is renamed or re-cased; only its file changed. It moved
/// because Scene Understanding needs the identical distinction the moment it
/// reports a distance to a tracked entity, and a second copy of a rule this
/// load-bearing is how the two copies come to disagree. It stays spelled
/// `World…` because that is the name every existing call site and test uses,
/// and a rename would be churn in exchange for nothing.
///
/// This is not presentation garnish. `docs/modules/WORLD-BUILD.md` makes it a
/// hard requirement: the target glasses are **monocular RGB only**, with no
/// LiDAR and no stereo, so any distance the system produces is inferred rather
/// than measured. That document's rule is absolute —
///
/// > World Build must never represent monocularly inferred depth as ground-truth
/// > physical distance. Any distance figure derived from monocular inference
/// > must be identifiable as an estimate wherever it is stored, *displayed*, or
/// > consumed by another module.
