import Foundation

/// The Tower's structured result channel, as it actually exists on the wire.
///
/// Contract: `docs/contracts/CARTRIDGE-RESULTS.md`, envelope
/// `cartridge_results.envelope/2026-08-23`. Every type here is a decoding of a
/// message the Tower genuinely sends today — verified against
/// `tower/tower/results/` and `tower/tower/routes/results_ws.py`, not against a
/// summary of them.
///
/// ## Why this is cartridge-blind
///
/// The envelope is generic and the `payload` is not. Nothing in this file knows
/// what a world is; it carries `payload` through as the dictionary the Tower
/// sent, and the cartridge that owns the contract decodes it. That is the same
/// split the Tower enforces on its own side with
/// `test_the_result_channel_core_is_cartridge_blind`, and it is what lets a
/// second cartridge arrive without touching the transport.
///
/// ## Why `[String: Any]` rather than `Codable`
///
/// `TowerClient` already decodes every inbound message with
/// `JSONSerialization`, and the Tower's error messages are deliberately
/// heterogeneous — `result_error` carries different extra keys per `reason`,
/// `result_unsubscribed` carries two keys and no `envelope_contract`, and
/// `frame_result` omits `mean_intensity` rather than nulling it. A strict
/// `Decodable` over that shape is a decoder that fails on messages the Tower
/// considers well-formed. Reading the keys we need and ignoring the rest is the
/// tolerant half of the robustness rule, and the contract's "any field may be
/// null, and null means absent" makes it the correct half.

// MARK: - Capability declaration

/// One cartridge the Tower declares it can report on.
///
/// `available == false` is **not** the same as absent: the Tower is saying it

/// ## Why this is a separate type from `TowerCartridgeOffer`
///
/// They answer different questions and cannot be merged without losing one of
/// them. A subscription offer says *"you may `result_subscribe` to this and
/// results will be pushed at you"*; this says *"there is a route, here is where
/// it starts, and here is the Tower's own reason it is not a subscription"*.
/// The giveaway is `resultType`, which a fetched contract does not have and
/// cannot be given a sensible default for — a `TowerCartridgeOffer` with an
/// invented `resultType` would be subscribable-looking data about something
/// that cannot be subscribed to.
///
/// `whyNotASubscription` is carried rather than dropped because it is the
/// Tower explaining a design decision in its own words — for Document Memory,
/// that document text is bulk and the result sender shares its send lock with
/// the frame path. That is worth showing an operator verbatim rather than
/// paraphrasing here, where it would rot.
///
/// **Not every HTTP contract appears here.** `world_builder.geometry/2026-08-25`
/// and `object_memory.observations/2026-08-26` are the same shape and are
/// declared nowhere — declaring them would mean moving their identifiers out of
/// adapter modules into the Tower's `contracts.py`, and its `registry.py` must
/// stay cartridge-blind so it cannot import an adapter. Those two lanes own the
/// move. Until they make it, this app hard-codes those two identifiers, and
