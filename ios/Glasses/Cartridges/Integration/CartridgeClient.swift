/// What the Tower has told this app it can do, per cartridge.
///
/// ## The single place the answer "nothing" is written down
///
/// The Tower declares no cartridge contracts, because it has no module runtime
/// to declare them for. That is one fact, and it belongs in one file rather
/// than restated in four clients where it would rot at different rates.
///
/// It is written as a lookup rather than as four hardcoded `.noContract`
/// literals so that the arrival of a real contract is an edit *here* plus a
/// client that can decode it — not a hunt through every cartridge for the place
/// its unavailability was hardcoded.
///
/// ## Where a declaration now comes from
///
/// The Tower declares its capabilities over the socket that is already open:
/// `{"type":"cartridges"}` after the pong, answered with the offers in
/// `TowerCartridgeDeclaration`. That is a *reply to a question about
/// capability*, not the dynamic module list `docs/04-MODULE-SYSTEM.md` forbids
/// before V1.0 and not the module-selection message
/// `docs/08-IOS-CARTRIDGE-SHELL.md` forbids — nothing here selects, starts, or
/// configures anything on the Tower, and the drawer is still the static
/// `Cartridge.catalog`.
///
/// So there are two sources, and they answer for different cartridges:
///
/// - `declared` — the local table, for cartridges the Tower offers no contract
///   for. Still empty, and still the whole truth for the three of them.
/// - `availability(for:declaredBy:isTowerReachable:)` — resolved against a live
///   declaration, for the cartridges the Tower does offer. The declaration is
///   cached on `TowerClient`, which is the object that owns the socket it
///   arrived on; caching it in a mutable static here would put connection state
///   in a namespace nothing can scope to a connection.
enum TowerCapabilities {

    /// Contracts declared by a local table rather than by the Tower.
    ///
    /// **Still empty, and now empty for a better reason than before.**
    ///
    /// This used to say the table was "the whole truth for Experimental CV Lab,
    /// Document Memory and Scene Understanding", because the Tower listed all
    /// three under `not_offered`. That premise is gone: the unified Tower
    /// declares all three over the wire, and `not_offered` is `[]`.
    ///
    /// What survives is the *rule*, which was always the point — a contract
    /// this app can reach is declared by the Tower, never hardcoded here.
    /// Duplicating one as a compile-time constant creates a second answer that
    /// can disagree with the Tower's, and the disagreement would be silent.
    ///
    /// **Object Memory is the deliberate exception, and it is not here either.**
    /// It is undeclared on purpose (the Tower's own §9), reached entirely over
    /// HTTP, and a `result_subscribe` for it is refused `unknown_cartridge`.
    /// Adding it to this table would be inventing a declaration the Tower
    /// pointedly declined to make.

    /// offering `world_builder.status/2026-09-…` would land there rather than
    /// being decoded on a guess.
    ///
    /// ## Why this went from one entry to five
    ///
    /// The test that pinned this set to a single element said, in its own
    /// words, that a second contract appearing "is still a review and not a
    /// silent widening". That review happened: four Tower lanes were unified on
    /// 2026-08-27, `GET /cartridges` went from one offer to four with
    /// `not_offered` empty, and each cartridge got a client that decodes its
    /// contract rather than a stub that refuses it.
    ///
    /// `document_memory` contributes **two** identifiers because the Tower
    /// declares two, deliberately: `status` is small and pushed on the socket,
    /// `library` is bulk text pulled over HTTP. They govern different
    /// transports with different failure modes, and a change to one is not a
    /// change to the other — collapsing them here would lose exactly that.
    ///
    /// **`world_builder.geometry/2026-08-25` is deliberately absent.** It is

    /// this set is consulted against *subscription* offers. Adding it would

/// pushes a continuous stream; Document Memory answers point queries;

/// plugin framework wearing a protocol's clothes, and

/// cartridge client conforms to this *and* to its own protocol, and the second
/// one is where the real work is described.
