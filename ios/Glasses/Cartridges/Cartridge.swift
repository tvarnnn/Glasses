/// What a person can do with a cartridge in this build.
///
/// ## Why this stopped being a roadmap vocabulary
///
/// This enum used to be `.next` / `.planned` / `.future` — "Up next",
/// "Planned", "Future" — and its doc said an `.available` case would violate
/// Rule 3 because *"no module runtime exists on either side yet: the Tower's
/// module container is V0.8 and the first module is V0.9."*
///
/// **That premise is refuted by the wire.** A Tower probed on 2026-08-26
/// reports `module_state: "active"` with `module_id: "experimental-cv"` — the
/// container exists and a module is running in it — and `GET /cartridges`
/// declares `world_builder.status/2026-08-25` with `available: true`, which
/// this build implements and has drawn 7,086 live points from during a
/// physical walk. Three cartridges now reach a person; refusing to say so was
/// the Rule 3 violation, not the reverse.
///
/// ## Why the axis changed, and not just the words
///
/// The old values answered *"where does this module sit on the Tower
/// roadmap?"* The drawer is a product surface, and a person reading a badge
/// there is asking *"is there anything here for me right now?"* Those are
/// different questions, and answering the first in the second's place produced
/// a badge set that was actively inverted: **Visual Q&A read "Planned" — a
/// readier-sounding word — while having no Tower code at all, and World
/// Builder read "Future" while being the one cartridge with a device-validated
/// walk behind it.**
///
/// Roadmap position has not been lost. It lives in `docs/03-ROADMAP.md` and
/// each cartridge's `specPath`, which is where a roadmap belongs. It is no
/// longer rendered to a wearer as though it were a capability.
///
/// ## What these values are NOT
///
/// **This is static catalog data about *this build*, not a live claim about
/// the Tower you happen to be connected to.** Whether a given Tower can serve
/// a cartridge right now is resolved per-connection by
/// `CartridgeAvailability.resolve` and rendered inside each workspace. A badge
/// reading "Ready to test" beside a workspace saying "Nothing yet" is not a
/// contradiction: the app is ready and that Tower is not. Keeping those two
/// separate is the reason this type consults nothing at runtime.
nonisolated enum CartridgeStatus: Equatable, CaseIterable {
    /// This build implements the cartridge and can show real Tower data for it.
    ///
    /// Not a promise that any particular Tower is serving it this second —
    /// see the type doc. It is a promise that there is something here to try.
    case readyToTest
    /// The Tower implements it; no contract is offered on the wire yet.
    ///
    /// The workspace opens and refuses truthfully. This is deliberately
    /// distinct from `notBuilt`: the two call for opposite responses — one is
    /// waiting on a Tower decision that is already costed, the other is waiting
    /// on a backend nobody has written.

        // result *type*: `live` rather than `status`, where the payload IS the
        // answer rather than progress toward a stored one. A cartridge that
