    ///   refused for a permission the user had already granted. Reading it is
    ///   *more* truthful than not reading it.
    ///
    /// - `connectIfIdle()` opens the Tower socket. Deliberately not
    ///   `connect()`: that means "the user asked to retry", refills the bounded
    ///   reconnect budget and will replace a live connection. Code running on
    ///   its own initiative gets neither privilege, so a Tower that has given
    ///   up stays visibly failed until a person intervenes.
