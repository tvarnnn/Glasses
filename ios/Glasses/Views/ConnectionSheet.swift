/// Every manual connection control, off the primary surface but always one tap

///
/// The old dashboard presented these three rows as a permanent setup checklist.
/// With registration state streamed from launch, camera permission read
/// automatically, and the Tower dialled automatically, a checklist is the wrong
/// resting state — it turns a solved problem into a chore. So the rows moved
/// here, reached by tapping the shell status bar.
///
/// Moving them must not make them unreachable, and that is the point of this
/// sheet rather than deleting them outright. The Tower's reconnect schedule is
/// bounded and ends at a visible `.failed`; `startAutomaticConnections()` runs
/// once per process and will not restart it. Manual retry is therefore the only
/// recovery, and it has to exist somewhere a person can find. Every row keeps
/// its action live in every state, exactly as before.
