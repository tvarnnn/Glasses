/// The cartridge tray: the shell's workspace picker.
///
/// ## What selecting a cartridge does, and does not do
///
/// Choosing a cartridge here changes **which workspace this app shows**. It
/// sends nothing to the Tower, selects no module there, and changes no Tower
/// state — there is no module-selection message in the protocol, and inventing
/// one is forbidden (docs/08-IOS-CARTRIDGE-SHELL.md). The Tower's vocabulary is
/// still exactly `ping`, `pong`, `frame`, `frame_result`, `stream_start`,
/// `stream_stop`.
///
/// The two were once fully independent, which is how a row came to be tappable
/// while its badge read "Future". They are no longer: a cartridge with nothing
/// to open cannot be `.readyToTest`, and one that ships a workspace is never
/// `.notBuilt`. `CartridgeCatalogTests` pins that in both directions.
/// The badge describes the *module's* position on the Tower roadmap; being
/// tappable describes whether *this app* ships a screen for it. Only cartridges
/// with a workspace are tappable — the rest stay exactly as they were, with no
/// `Button`, no `NavigationLink` and no tap target, because for them there
/// genuinely is nothing to open.
///
/// When the Tower can run modules, the active cartridge must be driven by what
/// the Tower reports is running, not by what was tapped here.
