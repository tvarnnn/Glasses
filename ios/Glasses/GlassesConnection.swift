/// Which rung of DAT's resolution enum the *next* capture session requests.
///
/// ## Why this exists, and why it is DEBUG-only
///
/// `StreamingResolution` is a **fixed three-case enum chosen once**, in the
/// `StreamConfiguration` handed to `session.addCamera(config:)`. It is not an
/// adaptive ladder: nothing in DAT renegotiates it mid-stream, and the P3
/// clean walk recorded **108 frames, every one 360x640, with zero variation**
/// (`docs/evidence/2026-08-26-p3-clean-walk-console.txt`). The app had this
/// value hardcoded to `.low`, so changing it required an edit and a rebuild.
///
/// That hardcoding blocks a measurement the Tower lane needs. Document
/// Memory's word recall is **0.429-0.810 at 360x640 and 0.957-1.000 at
/// 1280x720**, so its central premise cannot be tested at all without a way to
/// raise the rung on a device. Meanwhile 720p is *actively harmful* to World
/// Builder tracking — `min_sharpness = 25.0` is absolute and **73.3%** of 720p
/// frames are rejected as blurred.
///
/// Those two facts do not reconcile at a single rung, and choosing between
/// them is a cross-cartridge product decision that is not iOS's to make alone
/// (see `docs/agent-handoffs/TOWER-LANE-HANDOFF-FROM-MAC.md` 2.3). So this is
/// deliberately **a developer control, not a product setting**: it makes the
/// experiment runnable without pre-empting the decision.
///
/// ## The privacy consequence, which is the one that actually matters
///
/// This was reviewed and the first draft of this comment was found to omit it.
/// The rung is not merely an image-quality dial. `TowerClient.sendFrame` sends
/// the frame at its full captured size with **no downscale anywhere**, and when
/// the Tower's dataset recorder is armed it fsyncs those bytes to disk
/// verbatim — its own manifest declares `retains_raw_imagery: true`,
/// `redaction: "none"`, and the privacy tag `raw-imagery`. `.high` is **four
/// times the pixels** of the default.
///
/// So raising the rung raises the fidelity of unredacted, first-person imagery
/// of bystanders in a recording that persists. Face redaction does exist on the
/// Tower now, but it is applied only to World Builder's keyframe corpus, in
/// `_persist_keyframe`; the recorder's copy is written upstream of it and is
/// never redacted, so both copies coexist on disk.
///
/// That is why the footer on this control says so in plain words rather than
/// presenting the choice as OCR-versus-tracking, which is how it was first
/// written and which is a complete-sounding account that omits the axis a
/// person would most want to know about.
///
/// `.low` remains the default, so World Builder's physically-proven path is
/// unchanged unless someone deliberately changes it.

/// `isCaptureEngaged` excludes `.paused`, so during a **device-initiated

/// no-op offered as the primary action.
///
/// `.devicePaused` is not a state **this app** can leave, and the difference
/// between that and "the SDK has no such call" is one this comment used to
/// blur. Two separate facts, kept separate on purpose:
///
/// 1. **What is documented.** `docs/05-DAT-INTEGRATION.md` §104-107 and
///    `07-PLATFORM-CONSTRAINTS.md` §146 record the pause as *device-initiated*
///    — a temple or cap-touch press, or a thermal pause — and as **keeping the
///    connection alive, stopping delivery, and resuming to `.started` on its
///    own**. That is the device's behaviour, from the vendor's own docs.
///
/// 2. **What this app calls.** `GlassesConnection` calls exactly four things on
///    DAT for capture — `session.start()`, `session.stop()`, `stream.start()`
///    and `camera.stop()` — and none of them resumes a paused device.
///
/// Together those support exactly one claim: **this app has no resume to
/// offer**, which is what every screen here is written from. They do not
/// support "DAT exposes none". The previous wording — "there is no override to
/// write" — argued that from the list of calls this app happens to make, and a
/// list of one's own calls proves nothing about somebody else's SDK. If a
/// resume is ever found in DAT, what changes is this comment and the four calls
/// above; the documented device behaviour and the sentences on screen today
/// stay as they are. Until then a screen that finds `.devicePaused` says what
/// it is and waits.

///
/// ## Two of these are also written by a caller, not only by this file

/// and then translating the refusal back is a round trip that can only lose
/// information, and for `.ending` it loses the one thing a person needs (see
/// `captureIsShuttingDown`). So a case here means "why a capture did not
