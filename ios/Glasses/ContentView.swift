import SwiftUI

/// Root view, owner of the app's object graph, and the persistent shell.
///
/// ## The ownership invariant
///
/// `project` stays a `@StateObject` here, on a view that is always in the
/// hierarchy, and deliberately not on `GlassesApp`. A stored property on the
/// `App` struct would be initialised before `GlassesApp.init()` runs
/// `Wearables.configure()`, so `GlassesConnection` would touch the DAT SDK
/// before it is configured.
///
/// Everything else — the cartridge tray, the connection sheet, the developer
/// tools, and now the workspace — is presented *over* or *inside* this view
/// rather than replacing it, so the graph is never torn down.
/// `GlassesConnection.deinit` stops the camera and the device session, which
/// would kill a live stream. `GlassesConnection.init` logs
/// `[Glasses][Init] GlassesConnection created`, and that line must appear
/// exactly once per launch.
///
/// The rule that keeps it true, in one sentence: **`project` is created in
/// exactly one place; every other view receives its *children*; no view below
/// this one ever constructs anything that talks to DAT or the socket.**
///
/// Three things would break it:
/// - moving `project` to `@State` (which constructs eagerly on every `body`
///   re-evaluation, discarding all but the first — each discarded instance
///   having already spawned DAT tasks and then run its `deinit`);
/// - applying `.id(...)` at or above this view;
/// - a second scene. `TARGETED_DEVICE_FAMILY` includes iPad and visionOS, and
///   the app does not disable multiple scenes, so a second window would mean a
///   second `ContentView` identity and therefore a second `GlassesConnection`
///   and Tower socket against one set of glasses. "Once per launch" is really
///   "once per scene" — see the handoff for the build-setting fix, which needs
///   a real build to verify.
///
/// Switching workspaces does neither. The switch happens *below* `project`, so
/// a cartridge change swaps a subtree while the runtime graph — and any live
/// camera session — continues untouched.

            // of those three reaches it through `startCameraSession()` and
            // `stopCameraSession()` and touches DAT no other way. Object Memory
            // additionally refuses to start a capture that Home or World Builder
            // already started, and refuses to stop one it did not start itself.
