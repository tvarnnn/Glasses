/// Measures what clock DAT's `VideoFrame.sampleBuffer` presentation timestamps
/// are on.
///
/// **Pure observation.** It reads a timestamp and prints. It does not touch the
/// frame rate gate, the send window, the Tower, or World Builder, and removing
/// this file removes the whole experiment.
///
/// ## Why the reading happens where it does
///
/// `MonotonicClock.now` in the frame listener is sampled *inside* a
/// `Task { @MainActor … }`, so it carries main-actor queueing latency as well
/// as transport latency. Comparing a PTS against that number would measure the
/// two together and attribute both to the wire. This probe is therefore fed
/// from the listener closure itself, on DAT's own callback thread, before any
/// hop — so `hostNow` is as close to "the frame arrived" as this process can
/// observe.
///
/// ## What the numbers can and cannot settle
///
/// `CMTime` carries no clock identity. Two readings are therefore compared:
///
/// - `hostNow` — `mach_absolute_time` via `DispatchTime`, the same base as
///   `CMClockGetHostTimeClock()`.
/// - `pts` — whatever DAT put in the buffer.
///
/// If `offset = hostNow − pts` is small and **stable**, the PTS is on the host
/// clock and was stamped near arrival. If `offset` is large but stable, the PTS
/// is on some other epoch with a fixed relationship to boot time. If `offset`
/// **drifts**, the two clocks run at different rates, which is what an
/// independent oscillator on the glasses would produce. Drift is the single
/// most diagnostic quantity here, so it is reported as a slope over the run.
///
/// A stable offset alone does **not** prove capture time: a phone-side stamp
/// applied on arrival also produces a stable offset. What separates them is
/// jitter. If the PTS were stamped on arrival it would inherit every Bluetooth
/// delay, so `pts` deltas and `hostNow` deltas would move together and their
/// difference would be near zero. A capture-side stamp is regular regardless of
/// how irregularly the frame arrives, so its deltas stay clean while arrival
/// deltas scatter. **`jitterResidual` is that difference, and it is the
/// measurement this probe exists for.**
