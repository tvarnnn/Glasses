import Foundation

/// The bounded set of frame sends currently outstanding on one WebSocket.
///
/// Split out of `TowerClient` because the send window turned out to be the
/// pipeline's *rate limiter*, not merely a memory guard, and a rate limiter
/// deserves to be reasoned about — and tested — on its own.
///
/// ## Why this is a rate limiter
///
/// `TowerClient` admits a frame only while a slot is free, and a slot is held
/// from the moment a frame is handed to `URLSessionWebSocketTask.send` until
/// that send's completion handler runs. In steady state that makes the
/// achievable send rate exactly
///
///     admittedFPS = capacity / averageSlotLifetime
///
/// which is bounded *above* by the frame-rate gate and bounded *below* by
/// nothing at all. A capacity of 2 against a 290 ms slot lifetime is 6.9 fps
/// no matter how much bandwidth is spare, and against a 590 ms slot lifetime
/// is 3.4 fps — the two figures the physical baseline actually reported. The
/// window was doing its job; the job was mis-sized.
///
/// ## Capacity is a latency budget, not a magic number
///
/// Capacity is therefore derived rather than picked: it is how many frames the
/// target rate puts on the wire within the outbound latency we are willing to
/// carry (`SendWindow.capacity(forTargetFPS:latencyBudget:)`). Raising it
/// trades staleness for throughput on a latency-dominated link, and *only*
/// there — on a bandwidth-dominated link the slot lifetime grows in proportion
/// and the delivered rate is unchanged, which is the correct behaviour: the
/// window still sheds load rather than queueing it.
///
/// ## Stall detection is what makes that trade safe
///
/// A larger window is only safe if a wedged socket cannot sit on every slot
/// indefinitely. `URLSessionWebSocketTask` offers no way to cancel or time out
/// an individual outstanding `send`, so the only available remedy is at
/// connection granularity — which is why this type reports `isStalled(at:)`
/// and leaves the remedy to its owner. The physical baseline recorded a
/// 52-second peer-side stall; with no detection that is 52 seconds during
/// which every slot is held, every frame is dropped, and the frames eventually
/// written are 52 seconds stale. Bounding that is the freshness invariant in
/// docs/03-ROADMAP.md V0.7, stated in time rather than in frames.
///
/// A pure value type taking the current time as a parameter, so slot lifetime,
/// exhaustion and stall detection are all unit testable without a socket, a
/// timer, or real elapsed time — the same shape as `FrameRateGate`.
///
/// Every member is explicitly `nonisolated`: the project builds with
/// `SWIFT_DEFAULT_ACTOR_ISOLATION = MainActor`, which would otherwise make even
/// a capacity read main-actor-only. The stored properties are not annotated —
/// they are `Sendable` members of a global-actor-isolated value type, which
/// `SWIFT_APPROACHABLE_CONCURRENCY = YES` makes implicitly nonisolated.
/// `FrameRateGate` relies on exactly the same rule; if that build setting is
/// ever turned off, both types need revisiting together.
