/// The client for a Tower that has declared no document library.
///
/// It holds **no sample documents**. A handful of plausible rows would make the
/// workspace look finished and would be indistinguishable, on screen, from real
/// memories of the wearer's own documents — the single most misleading fixture
/// this app could ship. Test fixtures live in the test target, where they can
/// never reach a device.
///
/// ## The sentence that used to be here, and why it was deleted
///
/// > "The Tower keeps no document memory, so there is nothing to search. This
/// > app sends camera frames to the Tower while a session is running; it reads
/// > no text from them and receives none back."
///
/// The first clause is a claim about what the Tower **stores**, and it is now
/// false: the Tower has a document store, a journal, six routes and a typed
/// contract. The last clause is false too — a search receives titles, snippets
/// and, on one route, page text. Leaving it up would have told a person their
/// Tower keeps no record of what they read while it was keeping one.
///
/// What replaced it says only what is observable from here: **this** Tower has
/// declared nothing. It makes no claim about what any Tower stores, because
/// this app has no channel through which it could know that.
