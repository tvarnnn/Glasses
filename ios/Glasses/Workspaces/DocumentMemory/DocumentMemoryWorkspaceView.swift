/// The Document Memory workspace: pages the glasses passed and OCR read, and a

/// ## The one thing this screen must not do
///
/// Render an empty library as "no documents yet".
///
/// > An empty library is the expected result today. A client that renders an
/// > empty library as "no documents yet" is inviting a person to wait for
/// > something that is not coming.
///
/// On 9,199 frames of real first-person footage the page detector fired six
/// times and every one was a false positive — a venetian blind and a backlit
/// laptop keyboard. After the gate was re-derived it fires zero times, and no
/// capture on this platform has ever contained a sheet of paper. Separately, at
/// the 360×640 the glasses deliver, OCR returned zero dictionary words across
/// 919 sampled real frames dense with screen text.
///
/// So an empty answer here is **"never observed"**, with the Tower's own
/// `recording_limitations` attached — and "never observed" is said explicitly
/// not to mean the document does not exist.
///
/// ## The three answers are three sentences
///
/// `matched` renders the list, `not_found` says the memory was searched and
/// nothing matched, `no_observation` says the memory holds nothing that could
/// have matched. Collapsing the third into the second lets a gap in what the
/// glasses happened to see read as a statement about the world.
///
/// ## No camera controls
///
/// The recorder's Start/Stop is here, and the camera's is not: this cartridge
/// writes, its session does **not** follow the stream, and a session that
/// persists what a wearer read gets an explicit start. Starting the recorder
/// does not start the camera, and this screen cannot.
