/// The two Document Memory agreements this build was written against.
///
/// ## Why two, and why they must never be collapsed into one
///
/// `document_memory.status/2026-08-27` governs the **subscription**: a small
/// payload, pushed on the result socket, describing what the capture session is
/// doing and what is on disk. `document_memory.library/2026-08-27` governs
/// **HTTP**: the documents themselves, pulled on demand.
///
/// They are separate because they are carried by different transports with
/// different failure modes, and the Tower says so out loud —
///
/// > document text is bulk and is the most sensitive data this platform holds.
/// > The result socket shares its send lock with the frame path, and a listing
/// > is pulled on demand rather than pushed.
///
/// **A change to one is not a change to the other.** A build that treated them
/// as one identifier would have to refuse a working library because a status
/// field moved, or accept a changed library because the status contract still
/// matched. Two constants, compared separately, at the two places they arrive.
///
/// Both are opaque and compared for equality only. Dated rather than numbered
/// so nobody computes which is greater: a mismatch means "we are not talking
/// about the same agreement", which is neither newer nor older.
