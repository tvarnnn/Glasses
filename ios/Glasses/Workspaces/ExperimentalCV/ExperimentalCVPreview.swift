/// The CV Lab's live view: what the algorithm is looking at, drawn.
///
/// ## What this replaces
///
/// A screen of numbers. `edge_density: 0.071` is a true statement about a
/// frame and it tells a person wearing the glasses nothing about whether the
/// algorithm can see the doorway they are standing in. This is the panel that
/// answers that question, and everything else on the screen moved down to make
/// room for it.
///
/// ## Why this file holds no imagery it did not just draw
///
/// Every preview arrives with `treatment: "raw_ephemeral"`, which
/// `RedactionState` defines as *"Untreated imagery. Permitted only for the
/// live, in-memory view of what the wearer currently sees — never for anything
/// persisted, and never for anything a cartridge stored and re-served later."*
///
/// This app's half of that is structural rather than a promise:
///
/// - the session is `URLSessionConfiguration.ephemeral` with `urlCache = nil`,
///   so no byte reaches a disk cache or an in-memory one;
/// - every request asks for `.reloadIgnoringLocalAndRemoteCacheData`, because
///   the first point is a default somebody outside this file can change;
/// - `stop()` drops the image, and the view calls it `.onDisappear`, on pause,
///   on stop, when the run changes, and **when the app leaves the foreground**
///   — iOS captures an app-switcher snapshot on the way out, and a snapshot is
///   a copy on disk that nobody chose and no retention governs;
/// - exactly one `UIImage` is held at a time, replaced rather than appended to.
///
/// The Tower's half is `Cache-Control: no-store`, nothing written to disk, and
/// one image in memory per run. Neither side is trusting the other.
///
/// **A treatment this build does not recognise is not displayed.** There is no
/// lenient default here for the same reason `RedactionState` has none: an
/// unstated treatment is not a treatment, and a viewer that drew whatever
/// arrived would make the whole vocabulary decorative.

/// So: the picture, then a few figures that say whether it is healthy, then

/// ## What it will not do
///
/// - It does not switch on `visualKind` to decide what a picture MEANS. The
///   Tower's own `description` is drawn verbatim underneath, which is where
///   "these are NOT metres" comes from for a depth map — from the machine that
///   produced it, not from a string this app chose.
/// - It does not draw a picture whose treatment it could not read.
/// - It does not keep one. `.onDisappear` drops it.
