///
/// World Builder's client publishes a state that is always current, because a
/// world is being built continuously. This one has *commands*: an experiment is
/// chosen and started, paused, resumed, stopped. That difference is why there
/// is no shared `CartridgeDataSource<T>` protocol above both — the shared layer
/// stops at the question all four answer identically (may this be used, and why
/// not), and each cartridge describes its own interaction below that line.
///
/// Every command is `throws` and returns nothing. Each reports its outcome
/// through `state`, and that is not a stylistic choice: **the Tower answers a
/// start `accepted` before the experiment has loaded**, so a command that
/// returned an outcome would have to either block for up to two minutes or
/// return a success that has not happened yet. The outcome arrives as state, on
/// the next status document. `throws` covers only the narrower failure of not
/// being able to make the request at all.

/// > read a result with provenance attached
///
/// **All three of those exist.** `cv_lab_status` lists the experiments with

/// requests one; and every `frame_result` carries a `cv_lab` block whose

/// against a Tower that listed `experimental_cv` under `not_offered`, and it
/// went on being shipped after that stopped being true — which is precisely the
/// failure mode Rule 3 exists to prevent, told to a wearer in the app's own
/// voice.
///
/// So the string is gone, and so is the claim behind it. What is left is the
/// one thing this type can still honestly say: **this Tower has not offered the
/// cartridge to this connection.** That is a statement about a declaration, not
/// about the platform, and it is true exactly when it is used — this client is
/// the fallback `CartridgeClients` constructs when nothing Tower-backed was
/// injected.
///
/// It still declares **no experiments**, and that has not changed: the Tower is
/// the registry, and a picker populated from a hardcoded list is a claim that

// MARK: - The Tower-backed client

/// The Experimental CV Lab client that speaks to a live Tower.
///
/// ## Where it sits
///
/// ```
/// TowerClient                   owns the socket; decodes envelopes, gates on run_id
///     ↓ cvLabEvents, cartridgeResults
/// TowerExperimentalCVClient     owns the subscription, the commands, and the contract
///     ↓ stateUpdates, statusUpdates
/// ExperimentalCVViewModel       republishes into SwiftUI
///     ↓
/// ExperimentalCVWorkspaceView   renders facts
/// ```
///
/// Constructed by `ProjectManager` and held in `CartridgeClients`, so it
/// outlives every workspace switch. It owns no socket, opens no connection, and
/// never touches the frame path.
///
/// ## Why it both subscribes and sends
///
/// Because **a client that sends commands and does not also read status will
/// never learn that a start failed.** There is no `start_failed` message and
/// there cannot be one: an arm is asynchronous — the whole reason a start
/// returns immediately — so by the time a load fails, the command has already
/// been answered `accepted`, and a second reply to a reply is not a thing this
/// wire has. `lifecycle.state` becomes `failed` with a reason, and it arrives
/// on the subscription or on the next `cv_lab_status`. The subscription is
/// therefore not an optimisation; it is how half the outcomes are observed at
/// all.
///
/// The two channels are also *different transports for different things*, and
/// the Tower is deliberate about which carries which: the **document** is
/// published on the result channel, and the **commands** are not. `tower/results/`
/// is a read-only reporting surface, so a mutation must not travel on it — the
/// CV Lab's commands are plain socket messages instead, and there is no HTTP
/// surface for any of them.
///
/// ## State comes from the document, never from the command
///
/// Nothing here moves the state machine on the way *out* of `run`, `pause`,
/// `resume` or `stop`. Every reply, accepted or refused, carries the whole
/// status document, and that document is the only thing that writes `state`.
/// A refusal means *the request did not take effect*, with no partial
/// application, so a client that had already applied it optimistically would
/// have to undo something the Tower never did.
