/// The Experimental CV Lab's domain types, decoded from the Tower's status
/// document.
///
/// **This file used to open by saying nothing in it was a Tower protocol.** It
/// is now the opposite, and the change is the whole point of this work: the
/// Tower declares `experimental_cv.status/2026-08-27`, enumerates its
/// experiments with stable ids, and attaches provenance to every figure. So
/// these types are read off that document rather than invented ahead of it, and
/// `ExperimentalCVContract` names the three agreements they answer to.
///
/// What has **not** changed is where the list of experiments comes from. This
/// file still hard-codes no experiment, no algorithm and no metric name.
/// `docs/modules/EXPERIMENTAL-CV.md` calls its candidate list "intentionally
/// broad"; picking any subset here would make the iOS app the place the
/// experiment list is decided, which is exactly backwards. The Tower names its
/// experiments, names its metrics, and names their units; iOS displays those
/// names and never matches on them.
///
/// What iOS owns is the discipline the module spec imposes on results:
///
/// > Experiment output (detections, depth estimates, classifications, tracked
/// > poses, etc.) is model inference, not a measured sensor fact, unless the
/// > experiment specifically validates against a ground-truth reference.
/// > Results/logs must distinguish the two.
///
/// That one is enforced in the type system — see `CVMetric.provenance`, which
/// is not optional and has no default.
///
/// The other rule that used to be enforced here — *"avoid declaring an approach
/// 'better' without a measurement"* — is now enforced by **deletion**. See
/// `CVMetric`.

/// whoever decodes the Tower's reply, which is the only party that can answer
/// it.
///
/// ## Why there is no `baseline`, and no better/worse verdict
///
/// There used to be. `baseline`, `higherIsBetter`, a `comparison` property and
/// a `Comparison` enum that rendered *"Better by 0.4"* / *"Worse by 0.4"* — all
/// of it written against a contract that did not exist yet, and all of it
/// **deleted** now that the contract does.
///
/// The Tower's position is unambiguous and is not a temporary gap:
///
/// > `baseline` and `higher_is_better` — **always `null`**, and this is not an
/// > omission. … the Lab holds no reference run to compare against. A
/// > comparison against nothing is the "declaring an approach 'better' without
/// > a measurement" that `EXPERIMENTAL-CV.md` rules out. Offline corpus
/// > comparison is `scripts/cv_lab_benchmark.py`, and it is not this channel.
///
/// Keeping the machinery and relying on the nulls to keep it quiet would leave
/// a verdict renderer one non-null field away from firing, in a cartridge whose
/// entire purpose is not to claim more than was measured. Deleting it means the
/// verdict has no code path at all. If a future contract carries a reference
/// run, this comes back **with** that contract.

/// ## Why this is still a separate type from `ExperimentalCVState`
///
/// It used to be separate because the frame channel had **no contract behind it
/// and no provenance attached**, and folding it into the cartridge state would
/// have meant either inventing a state the Tower never offered or letting
/// `.unsupported` carry a payload.
///
/// Half of that reason is now gone: `frame_result` carries a `cv_lab` block
/// under `experimental_cv.frame_result/2026-08-27`, with provenance, the
/// experiment's id and name, and the run it belongs to. The other half stands,
/// and is why the split survives: **it is a different transport with a
/// different contract identifier and a different rate.** The status document
/// arrives ~1.3 times a second and describes a run; this arrives per frame and
/// describes one frame. The Tower versions the two separately for exactly that
/// reason, and a client that merged them would be unable to implement the
/// read-only half alone — which is what a Release build with no camera is.
///
/// ## The pair rule
///
/// `result_value` is a bare number whose meaning belongs to the experiment;
/// `result_label` is the experiment's own name for it. Neither is readable
/// alone here — they are held as one `Labelled` or not at all — so no view can
/// render the number under a caption of its own invention.
