import Foundation
import SwiftUI

/// The Experimental CV Lab workspace: a measurement surface for experiments the
/// Tower runs.
///
/// ## What this screen may and may not claim
///
/// It used to open by saying the Tower "runs exactly one experiment, and it
/// chose which one when it started", that there was "no message to list the
/// experiments, pick a different one, or start or stop the one that is
/// running", and that "the reply names the *number*, not the experiment, so
/// this screen cannot even say which one produced it".
///
/// **Every one of those sentences is now false.** `cv_lab_status` lists the
/// experiments; `cv_lab_start` selects and arms one, replacing whatever ran;
/// pause, resume and stop are requests with legible refusals; and every
/// `frame_result` carries a `cv_lab` block naming the experiment, the run and
/// the provenance. So the copy is gone along with the limitation it described.
/// What replaced it is not a promise — it is the Tower's own document, drawn
/// field for field.
///
/// Two things this screen still refuses to do, and both are the Tower's
/// position as much as this app's:
///
/// 1. **No better/worse verdict.** `baseline`, `higher_is_better` and
///    `confidence` are `null` on every metric, always, because the Lab holds no
///    reference run to compare against. The machinery that would have rendered
///    a verdict is deleted rather than left dormant — see `CVMetric`.
/// 2. **No annotated frame.** `artifact` is `null` in this contract with a
///    stated reason: no redaction-state vocabulary is shared between the two
///    sides and no artifact fetch contract exists on either. An experiment gets
///    no privacy exemption for being a debug surface.
///
/// ## Debug and Release are genuinely different products here
///
/// The frame path is `#if DEBUG` (`ProjectManager`), so **a Release build has
/// no camera, sends no frame, and receives no `frame_result`.** That predates
/// this work and is not fixed by it. What this screen does about it:
///
/// - the read-only half is drawn in full, because it is fully reachable: the
///   declaration, the subscription and the status document do not depend on
///   frames;
/// - no control that starts an experiment is drawn at all, because there is no
///   `startCameraSession` in this configuration to feed the experiment it would
///   arm — see `TowerExperimentalCVClient.canSendCommands`;
/// - `.running` is never drawn as **live**, because live requires this build to
///   be streaming and `source.receiving_frames` to be true, and the first half
///   is permanently false here.
///
/// ## No capture controls here, deliberately
///
/// Home carries the app's session controls; this workspace adds none, and that
/// is unchanged by gaining experiment controls. Starting an experiment is a
/// request to the *Tower* about what to compute; it opens no camera, and
/// `startCameraSession()` is not reachable from this file. The invariant that
/// the app never starts the camera on its own remains structural — one button
/// per workspace that has one, no `.onAppear` anywhere — and this workspace
/// still has none.
