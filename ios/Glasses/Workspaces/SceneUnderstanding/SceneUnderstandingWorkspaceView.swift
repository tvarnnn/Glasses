/// The Scene Understanding workspace: what the Tower can currently see, stated
/// as carefully as the measurements require.
///
/// ## The three things this screen exists to get right
///
/// 1. **Every count is a floor.** `count_is_lower_bound` is `true` on every
///    payload, and it appeared **zero times** in this app until this screen was
///    rewritten. An undercount published without disclosure looks exactly like
///    a quiet room, so the disclosure sits with the counts rather than under a
///    disclosure triangle, and the measured recall figures are shown beside it.
/// 2. **Five silences, five sentences.** "Stopped", "still loading", "failed",
///    "running but no frame yet" and "looked and saw nothing" are five
///    different facts. Only the last is about a room. Rendering them alike
///    would tell a person there is nobody there when in fact nobody has pressed
///    Start.
/// 3. **A paused scene is not a current one.** `.lastKnown` gets its own
///    heading, its own age and its own colour. `.observing` is the only state
///    that may be drawn as now.
///
/// ## What it will never show
///
/// A list of people. There is no per-person row on this wire, no track handle,
/// no box, and no field that could hold one — so there is nothing to draw a row
/// from, and this screen is built so that adding one would mean changing the
/// model rather than adding a `ForEach`.
///
/// ## No camera controls, and no session controls either
///
/// As with Experimental CV Lab: the app's session controls stay on Home and
/// World Builder, so the set of places that can start the camera does not grow.
/// This screen additionally sends **nothing** to the Tower — see
/// `SceneUnderstandingContract.phoneSendsNothingNote`.
