/// it.

/// `status`. This one publishes `live`, because the payload **is** the answer
/// rather than progress toward one. A `result_subscribe` naming the wrong

    // operator surface: `IOS-to-Tower.md` §6.2 is explicit that opening a
    // cartridge on the phone sends nothing, and a Tower-side test asserts the
    // wire stays silent. The session follows the stream instead —
    // `stream_start` opens it, `stream_stop` or a disconnect ends it — which is
    // the normal case for a wearable.
    //
    // Two further reasons not to grow a Start button here, both measured:
    //
    // 1. `POST /scene/resume` on a stopped scene answers **200 with
    //    `state: "stopped"` and no refusal field**. A client keyed on the
    //    status code would report success for a verb that did nothing. The
    //    cheapest way to get that right is not to send it.
    // 2. A phone's `stream_stop` can already end a session an operator started
    //    by hand. Adding a second way for the phone to move the session makes
    //    that worse, not better.
