/// The Scene Understanding cartridge, as the Tower actually serves it.
///
/// Contract: `scene_understanding.live/2026-08-27`, `docs/contracts/TOWER-UNIFIED-CARTRIDGES.md`
/// §7 and `tower/docs/contracts/CARTRIDGE-RESULTS.md` §14. Every type below was
/// written against bytes curled off a running Tower, not against a summary of
/// them.
///
/// ## The result type is `live`, and that is not a naming detail
///
/// World Builder's `status` describes a *build* — how far it has got. This
/// payload **is** the answer: what is in front of the camera right now. There
/// is no progress to report and nothing accumulates, which is why the state
/// vocabulary below has no `finalizing` and no `finalized`.
///
/// ## What this file used to contain, and why it does not any more
///
/// It used to model `SceneEntity`, `SceneRelationship`, `SceneTrackID`,
/// `ScenePosition` and `SceneFrameOfReference`: per-entity rows, each with a
/// track handle, a bearing and a distance. The Tower refuses every one of them,
/// and refuses them **structurally** —
///
/// > There is no key anywhere in this payload that could hold an entity or a
/// > relation.
///
/// `tracks`, `relations` and `confidence` are `null` on every payload, each
/// with an `*_absent_reason` and a refusal list naming `track_id`, `box`,
/// `facing`, `visible_eyes` and `confidence`. iOS asked for a session-scoped
/// anonymous track handle (`IOS-to-Tower.md` §4.1) and a signed bearing (§4.3);
/// V1 serves neither, and the handoff is explicit that if that is the wrong
/// trade it becomes a contract change with a new identifier, **not a field
/// quietly populated later**.
///
/// Types that can never be filled are not harmless. They are an invitation:
/// the next person to read them concludes the data is coming and builds the
/// screen that waits for it. Worse, `SceneTrackID` plus a timestamp is exactly
/// the joinable pair the Tower refuses to publish — a stable handle lets a
/// recipient assemble the per-person dwell timeline this cartridge keeps none
/// of. Modelling the shape is the first half of laundering persists-nothing
/// onto the consumer. So they are gone, and what replaced them is the
/// aggregate the wire actually carries: a count, a per-label side histogram,
/// and a people block that is a count and nothing else.
///
/// ## What remains, and what each surviving rule is for
///
/// **No identity.** There is no name, no descriptor, no handle, and no field
/// that could carry one. No face recognition exists on this platform: no
/// detector is present, and the keypoints the pose model produces locate eyes
/// and ears as anonymous landmarks that yield no descriptor and support no
/// matching.
///
/// **No gaze.** `SceneFacing` describes body and head orientation and the
/// labels say "facing your direction" — never "looking at you". There is no eye
/// tracking on the target glasses, so there is no gaze to report at any
/// confidence.
///
/// **No absence claims.** A count of zero means zero *confirmed tracks in the
/// camera's forward cone*, which is a statement about the camera and not about
/// the room — and it is an undercount besides. `absence_means:
/// "not-visible-to-this-cartridge"` is the Tower saying so in the payload.
///
/// **No distances and no bearings.** Not because they would be unlabelled, but
/// because they are not on the wire at all. `where` is a coarse signed bearing
/// under another name, and it is published as side *counts* per label rather
/// than one side per label, because one side cannot describe a chair on the
/// left and a chair on the right.
