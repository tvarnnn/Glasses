/// The real Scene Understanding client.
///
/// ## Where it sits
///
/// ```
/// TowerClient                   owns the socket, decodes the envelope, knows no cartridge
///     ↓ cartridgeResults
/// TowerSceneUnderstandingClient owns the subscription and this contract
///     ↓ stateUpdates
/// SceneUnderstandingViewModel   republishes into SwiftUI
///     ↓
/// SceneUnderstandingWorkspaceView renders counts, and the disclosure they are owed
/// ```
///
/// ## What it sends: nothing but a subscription
///
/// No `stream_start`, no `POST /scene/start`, no control message of any kind.
/// `IOS-to-Tower.md` §6.2 is explicit that opening a cartridge on the phone
/// sends nothing and a Tower-side test asserts the wire stays silent. The
/// session follows the camera stream, which the app already opens and closes
/// for its own reasons — see `SceneUnderstandingContract.phoneSendsNothingNote`
/// for the two measured reasons a Start button here would be worse than
/// useless.
///
/// ## What it refuses to keep: everything, the moment a session ends
///
/// This is the one place this app differs from `TowerWorldBuilderClient` on
/// purpose. That client deliberately keeps its last world across a socket drop,
/// because a partly-built world is still true when the connection returns and
/// availability already renders the disconnection.
///
/// **A scene is not.** A scene held past the end of a session is a claim about
/// a room the wearer has left, and no staleness number makes it safe, because a
/// client that draws counts above a staleness line shows the room first. So
/// this client discards on all three of:
///
/// - `lifecycle.state == "stopped"` — the Tower has already discarded its own
///   copy (`scene_available: false`, `counts`/`where`/`people` null), and
///   `SceneUnderstandingState.forReading` maps it to `.idle`;
/// - the socket leaving `.online` — a disconnect *ends the session* here, since
///   the session follows the stream. World Builder's "keep it, availability
///   explains" reasoning does not transfer;
/// - `lifecycle.session_id` changing — two payloads from two tracking sessions
///   must not be compared, and holding one across the boundary is the mildest
///   form of comparing them.
///
/// Pause is the deliberately different case and is the one thing that *is*
/// kept: `.lastKnown`, with its age, visually apart from observing.
