import Combine

/// One tap that starts both halves of remembering: the Tower's producer, and
/// the glasses camera.
///
/// ## Why this type exists
///
/// Before it, Object Memory's Start button started the *producer* and nothing
/// else. A person who pressed it on a phone with no capture running got an
/// `active` session with `attached_capture_id: null`, no frames, no records,
/// and no sentence anywhere on the screen explaining that they also had to go
/// to Home and press a second, differently-named button first. The cartridge
/// was not self-contained, and the screen did not say so.
///
/// ## What it owns, and what it very deliberately does not
///
/// It owns **sequencing and honesty**, and no camera code whatsoever. The
/// camera is `GlassesConnection` — still the only type in this app that talks
/// to DAT, still reached through `startCameraSession()` / `stopCameraSession()`
/// and nothing else. The Tower's producer is `CartridgeSessionHTTPClient`
/// behind `ObjectMemoryClient`, unchanged. This composes the two.
///
/// Both are reached through protocols rather than concrete types, and that is
/// not ceremony: `GlassesConnection`'s capture surface is `#if DEBUG`, needs a
/// paired device and a permission grant, and cannot be driven from a test at
/// all. A seam is the only way this sequencing is testable, and untested
/// sequencing is exactly where the race below would live.
///
/// ## The one rule inherited from `ObjectMemorySession.swift`
///
/// **`state` is intent. `following` is fact.** Every phase this type publishes
/// that claims something is being recorded is derived from
/// `snapshot.isFollowingACapture`, and never from `state`. The whole reason
/// `.waitingToBeFollowed` and `.notObserved` are separate cases from
/// `.remembering` is that "we asked" must never be drawn as "it is happening".

// MARK: - The camera seam

/// The half of `GlassesConnection` this cartridge is allowed to reach.
///
/// Five members, all of which already existed or were added for this: there is
/// no camera behaviour here that `GlassesConnection` does not already own, and
/// there is deliberately no `pause`.
///
/// **This app has no way to pause a stream.** `GlassesConnection` calls exactly
/// four things on DAT for capture — `session.start()`, `session.stop()`,
/// `stream.start()` and `camera.stop()` — and none of them pauses one, so a
/// `pauseCapture()` here would be a method with nothing to call. That is a fact
/// about this app's code, and it is the only fact needed: this protocol can
/// only expose what `GlassesConnection` already owns.
///
/// It is **not** a claim that DAT exposes no pause, which an earlier version of
/// this comment made and could not support — the evidence offered was the list
/// of calls this app happens to make. What is separately documented, in
/// `docs/05-DAT-INTEGRATION.md` §104-107, is the pause that does exist: a
/// *device-initiated* one, from a temple or cap-touch press or heat, which
/// stops delivery, keeps the connection, and resumes on its own. That is
/// `CaptureClaim.devicePaused`, it is something this app observes rather than
/// commands, and the copy beside Pause says so.

/// anything — branching on state, holding a flag, calling DAT — because that is
/// capture behaviour living outside the one type that owns it. If you find
/// yourself writing that here, the invariant "exactly one camera pipeline, in
/// `GlassesConnection`" is the thing being broken.
///

/// ## The start order, and why it is this way round
///
/// 1. **`POST start` first, before any capture exists.** The contract is
///    explicit that this is supported: "Start before the camera is normal. The
///    session goes `active` with `attached_capture_id: null` and the next
///    capture to open finds the gate open." Doing it first is what makes the
///    common case lossless.
///
///    The other order loses frames or loses everything. A producer that
///    attaches to a capture already in progress runs with
///    `--attach-mode from-now` and **does not read back the earlier frames**,
///    so starting the camera first throws away however long the round trip to
///    the Tower took. Worse, if the Start were to fail after the camera came
///    up, a capture would be open against a closed gate with a camera running
///    and nothing remembering.
///
/// 2. **Then the camera, and only if nothing already holds it.** Home and World
///    Builder can each have started it, and `startCameraSession()` refuses when
///    a session exists. Calling it anyway would be asking for a refusal and
///    then having to explain one.
///
/// 3. **Then converge on `following`, with a deadline.** A 200 from Start is
///    intent. Whether a producer actually attached is `following`, and that is
///    read back, repeatedly, until it is true or the budget runs out. If the
///    budget runs out with the session `active` and nothing followed, the
///    screen says exactly that — `notObserved` — rather than claiming a
///    recording that this app has never observed.
///
/// ## Ownership

/// ending it would silently reach across two other screens and turn off a
