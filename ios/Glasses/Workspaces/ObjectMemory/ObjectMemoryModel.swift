/// ## The one thing to read before changing anything in this file
///
/// **This cartridge does not know where anything is.** `spatial_ref` is `null`
/// at every level of every payload, always, and is nulled on read by the Tower
/// rather than merely left unset. The `where` object is a *frame reference* — a
/// capture id, a frame sequence number, a camera, and a box in normalised frame
/// coordinates. It points back into a recording. It is not a place, it does not
/// become a place by being drawn on something, and a bounding box under
/// `kind: "frame-reference"` must never be projected into any world frame.
///
/// Three further claims travel *in* the payload rather than only in
/// `docs/contracts/OBJECT-MEMORY.md`, and every one of them constrains the
/// copy in `ObjectMemoryCopy`:
///
/// - `claim: "category-was-visible-once"` — a record says a category was in
///   view **once**. Never that it is there now.
/// - `identity: "category-not-instance"` — `laptop` means *a* laptop. Not
///   "your laptop", and two `laptop` records are not evidence about the same
///   object. Nothing re-identifies anything across sightings.
/// - `absence_means: "not-observed-by-this-cartridge"` — an empty answer is a
///   statement about what this cartridge captured, never about the world. That
///   is why `last-seen` answers 200 with `observed: false` and never 404.
///
/// ## Encoding disciplines this file inherits
///
/// `null` means **absent**, never `0` and never `""`. Every nullable wire field
/// below is an Optional, and nothing is defaulted to a number: a missing
/// `best_score` is "not tracked", and substituting `0.0` would invent a claim
/// of no evidence.
///
/// The contract identifier is **opaque**. Compared for equality, never parsed,
/// never split on `/`, never ordered. A different date is a different
/// agreement, neither newer nor older.

// MARK: - The contract this build implements

/// three claim values that travel with every payload under it.

/// this contract can carry — fails a decode in one place instead of quietly
/// rendering under the old wording.
