/// The Object Memory workspace: what the Tower recorded as visible, and when.
///
/// ## This view writes no prose
///
/// Every sentence on screen comes from `ObjectMemoryCopy`, including button
/// labels and section headings, and `ObjectMemoryCopyTests` asserts over that
/// type's whole output. A `Text("…")` literal added here would escape the test
/// that exists to stop this screen from claiming more than the sensor can
/// support — so the rule is absolute rather than stylistic: **no user-facing
/// string literal in this file.**
///
/// ## What the layout is arguing
///
/// A row leads with what a record actually says — *a laptop was visible*, and
/// when — and keeps the claim caveat beside it rather than in a disclosure. The
/// frame reference goes **inside** the disclosure, because it is the field a
/// reader most wants to misread as a place, and it is never shown without
/// `frameCaveat` immediately under it.
///
/// The bounding box is drawn as text, not as a rectangle over anything. There
/// is no map, no floor plan, and no marker: this cartridge has `spatial_ref:
/// null` in every payload and knows where nothing is.
///
/// ## One Start button, and what it starts
///
/// **This workspace can now begin a capture, and it is the third place in the
/// app that can.** That is a deliberate change to an invariant that used to
/// read "exactly two", and the reason is that the previous arrangement did not
/// work as a product.
///
/// It does not receive the `GlassesConnection` itself. It receives
/// `ObjectMemoryRecordingCoordinator`, built once on `ProjectManager` from the
/// one connection this app has — so the set of types that can reach DAT is
/// unchanged, and the coordinator outlives every cartridge switch.
///
/// The controls this screen grew on 2026-08-27 started and stopped the Tower's
/// **producer** — the process that reads a recording and writes observations —
/// and nothing else. So a person who opened this cartridge and pressed Start
/// got a session that was genuinely `active`, with `attached_capture_id: null`,
/// no frames, no records, and no sentence on screen telling them that the
/// camera lives behind a differently-named button on a different screen. The
/// button worked and the cartridge did not.
///
/// Now one tap runs `ObjectMemoryRecordingCoordinator`, which asks the Tower
/// first — the documented order, and the one that avoids both the closed-gate
/// race and `--attach-mode from-now` losing the opening seconds — and then
/// starts the camera **only if nothing already holds it**. There is still
/// exactly one camera pipeline and one owner of it: `GlassesConnection`. This
/// screen calls `startCameraSession()` and `stopCameraSession()` and knows
/// nothing else about DAT.
///
/// Stop honours ownership. A capture Home or World Builder started is left
/// running, because ending it from here would reach across two other screens,
/// and the copy says which of the two happened.
///
/// None of this makes the query half writable. It is still two `GET`s, real
/// deletion still lives on the Tower where a human types it against a store
/// they can name, and the session router still cannot touch the store.
///
/// The composed control exists because the alternative was measured. The
/// 2026-08-26 physical run remembered 64 real observations and **every one of
/// them required a person to find a capture directory and start a producer in a
/// second terminal.** That is not a product either.
///
/// ## The one rule this screen cannot get wrong
///
/// **Liveness is drawn from `following`, never from `state`.** The session
/// payload says so itself. A Pause whose producer ignores `SIGTERM` answers 200
/// with `state: "paused"` while the process keeps recording, so a Pause button
/// keyed on `state` tells a person they stopped being recorded when they did
/// not. Every liveness affordance below reads `memory.liveness`, which reads
/// `following`, and the contradiction between the two is shown loudly rather
/// than reconciled.

    /// query and a list of answers, and losing those on a cartridge switch
    /// costs a person one tap. This holds whether this app started the capture
    /// that is running — and losing THAT costs a person a Stop button that
    /// leaves the glasses recording, because a rebuilt coordinator believes it
    /// started nothing and therefore stops nothing.
    ///

    /// as it did. The camera half then reports that it cannot be reached
    /// rather than pretending it can.
    ///
    /// `memory` is constructed through `StateObject`'s autoclosure and

    /// takes the *client* rather than the view model: sharing one view-model
