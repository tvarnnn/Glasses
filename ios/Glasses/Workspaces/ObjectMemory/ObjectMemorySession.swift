/// Start, Pause, Resume and Stop for a cartridge, over HTTP.

/// ## The one rule to read before changing anything in this file
///
/// **`state` is intent. `following` is fact.** The payload says so itself, in
/// `state_means: "intent-not-liveness"`, and this is not a stylistic note —
/// the two come apart exactly when it matters most.
///
/// A Pause whose producer ignores `SIGTERM` answers **200** with
/// `state: "paused"` and `changed: true` — a positive claim that the action
/// took effect — while `following` still names the capture and the process is
/// still alive and still recording. That was reproduced during the
/// 2026-08-27 integration; it is not a hypothetical. **A Pause button keyed on
/// `state` tells a person they stopped being recorded when they did not**, and
/// there is no worse sentence this app can put in front of a wearer.
///
/// So every liveness claim in this file and in `ObjectMemoryCopy` reads
/// `following`, and `state` is only ever rendered as *what was asked for*. The
/// two are named apart in the API — `isFollowingACapture` against `state` —
/// so that a future caller reaching for the wrong one has to type the word
/// "state" to get it.
///
/// ## Why this type is generic and not `ObjectMemorySession`
///
/// The Tower's surface is keyed by cartridge id and knows no cartridge: the
/// next producer that needs a button gets one for free. Today only
/// `object_memory` answers it and any other name is a 404, which is a
/// *configuration* answer rather than a refusal. Mirroring that shape here
/// costs nothing and means the second cartridge to grow a Start does not
/// arrive by copying this file.
///
/// ## Nothing is persisted, deliberately
///
/// A Tower that restarts comes back `stopped`. This app must therefore never
/// cache a session state across a launch, or re-assert one it remembers:
/// resuming a memory of what a camera sees without anybody asking again is the
/// wrong direction to fail in. Every state here comes from a live read.

// MARK: - The contract this build implements
