import Foundation

/// A primary workspace this app can present for a cartridge.
///
/// ## Why this is separate from `CartridgeStatus`
///
/// The two answer different questions, about different machines, and conflating
/// them would produce a lie in one direction or the other:
///
/// - `CartridgeStatus` describes a **module's position on the Tower roadmap**
///   — `next`, `planned`, `future`. It is deliberately missing an `available`
///   case, because no module runtime exists on the Tower at all: the module
///   container is V0.8 and the first module V0.9 (docs/03-ROADMAP.md), and
///   `ProductShellTests` fails loudly if that ever silently changes.
///
/// - `CartridgeWorkspace` describes whether **this app has a screen** for the
///   cartridge. That is a fact about the iPhone, and it is true today for World
///   Builder whatever the Tower can or cannot do.
///
/// Keeping them apart is what lets the drawer open a World Builder workspace
/// without any of it implying the Tower is running World Builder. Opening a
/// workspace is local navigation. It sends nothing, selects nothing on the
/// Tower, and changes no Tower state — docs/08-IOS-CARTRIDGE-SHELL.md forbids
/// inventing a module-selection message, and none is invented.
///
/// A cartridge with no workspace stays exactly as it was: an informational row.
///
/// ## Five cases, and still an enum
///
/// Product Shell V2 had one case and argued that a `switch` beat a workspace
/// registry. Somewhere around four or five is the number at which that argument
/// is usually abandoned in favour of a protocol and a lookup table, so it is
/// worth restating why it holds better now than it did then, not worse:
///
/// - the set is still **closed and compiled in**. A workspace is a SwiftUI view
///   in this binary; there is no dynamic module list to render
///   (`docs/04-MODULE-SYSTEM.md` forbids building one before V1.0), so nothing
///   can appear here that was not compiled;
/// - exhaustiveness is the feature. Adding a case makes the compiler demand the
///   arm in `ContentView`, where a registry would silently fall back to Home;
/// - the anti-pattern the roadmap warns about is per-cartridge *conditionals
///   scattered through one enormous view*. There is exactly one `switch`, in
///   one place, whose arms are one-line constructor calls into separate files.
///
/// What did change is that the workspaces now share a *client* layer —
/// `CartridgeClient`, `CartridgeAvailability`, `CartridgePhase` — because that
/// is where the genuine commonality turned out to be. The screens have almost
/// nothing in common; the question "may this be used, and why not" is identical
/// for all four.

    /// The fifth, and the first whose Tower half actually answers.

    /// read-only HTTP routes do not move a module's roadmap position. That was
    /// right about the roadmap and wrong about what the badge is for: it now
    /// answers what a person can do in this build, and two live routes with a
    /// decoder pinned against a real Tower's bytes is something they can try.
    /// `CartridgeCatalogTests` pins every entry's status against the evidence
    /// recorded beside it.

/// One row of the cartridge drawer, and the **only** place the question "may
/// this cartridge be opened?" is answered.
///
/// ## Why this type exists
///
/// It used to be answered in four places. `Cartridge.selectable` filtered the
/// catalog on `workspace != nil`; `workspaceCartridge(forID:)` re-checked the
/// same thing to reject a stale stored id; and the drawer — which did not
/// consult either — re-derived it twice more, once to decide whether to wrap a
/// row in a `Button` and once inside the row to choose an accessibility hint.
///
/// Four answers to one question, agreeing only because four people happened to
/// write the same expression. Nothing made them agree, so nothing would have
/// caught them diverging: a cartridge could have been tappable in the drawer
/// and absent from `selectable`, and the tests — which only ever asked
/// `selectable` — would have kept passing while describing a drawer that no
/// longer existed. `selectable`'s doc comment already claimed to be "every
/// cartridge the drawer may present as openable"; this type is what makes that
/// sentence true by construction rather than by coincidence.
///
/// ## Why an enum, and not a `Bool`
///
/// The same argument `CartridgeWorkspace` makes above, one level down. A row
/// carrying `isOpenable: Bool` alongside an optional workspace can still hold
/// the contradiction — `true` with nothing to open — and the drawer would have
/// to force-unwrap or silently do nothing. Here the openable case *carries* the
/// non-optional `CartridgeWorkspace`, so the impossible state cannot be
/// written down, and the `switch` in the drawer gets the workspace as a fact
/// rather than as a second lookup.
///
/// This is not a registry. Nothing is keyed by id and nothing is looked up
/// dynamically; the rows are a `map` over the compiled-in catalog in catalog
/// order, which is exactly what `docs/04-MODULE-SYSTEM.md` permits before V1.0.
