// MARK: - What the Tower says about the session behind a world

/// The `session` block of a `world_builder.status` payload, decoded.
///
/// ## Why this block is read at all
///
/// `docs/contracts/WORLD-BUILDER-IOS.md` §2.4 records that iOS consumes
/// `model_state` and `world_snapshot` and none of the Tower-native evidence
/// beside them. That is still the rule for the *figures*. This block is the one
/// exception, and it earns it by answering a question no figure can:
/// **whose world is this?**
///
/// A `WorldSnapshot` describes a world directory on the Tower's disk. It says
/// nothing about which capture produced it, so a snapshot of a world finished
/// an hour ago is indistinguishable — field for field — from a snapshot of the
/// one the wearer is walking through right now. On 2026-08-24 the phone showed
/// camera LIVE beside "Capture has ended." and a frozen figure count, and both
/// halves were telling the truth about different machines.
///
/// Nothing here is a figure and nothing here is drawn as one. It is identity
/// and lifetime, which is exactly what the gate needs.

///
/// ## What the phone can and cannot establish today
///
/// The Tower mints a capture id in its web process at the moment the phone
/// sends `stream_start`, and it does not tell the phone what that id is:
/// `stream_start` gets no reply, and the `stream_started` message that would
/// carry one is deliberately unimplemented on the Tower
/// (`tower/docs/agent-handoffs/IOS-WORLD-BUILDER-INTEGRATION.md` §5). So the
/// phone cannot compare capture ids, and nothing here pretends it can.
///
/// What it can establish, from the payload alone, is **liveness**. The Tower
/// attaches a builder to every capture at the moment the id is minted, one per
/// capture lineage; the result channel prefers a world whose writer lock is
/// held by a running process; and a session fed by that builder records
/// `frame_source: "live-capture"`, its capture directory's name, and a null
/// `ended_at` for exactly as long as it runs. A snapshot with all three, while
/// this phone has a bracket open, is this session's. A snapshot with any of
/// them missing describes a capture that is over, replayed, or synthetic —
/// none of which this phone opened.
///
/// That is strictly weaker than an id comparison and strictly stronger than
/// what shipped before, which was nothing. When `stream_started` lands, the
/// equality check drops into `binding(isCaptureBracketOpen:session:modelState:)`
/// and nothing else moves.
