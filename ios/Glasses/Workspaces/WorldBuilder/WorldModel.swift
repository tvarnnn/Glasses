/// how many poses it kept, and how far it thinks the camera travelled. The
/// distance carries `WorldScaleSemantics` because it is a spatial figure and
/// `docs/modules/WORLD-BUILD.md` admits no unlabelled ones — on monocular RGB
/// it will normally be `.relative`, in which case it is a shape statistic and
/// not a number of metres, and `distanceDisplayable` refuses to show it as one.
///
/// ## A camera position and a segment origin are not the same figure
///
/// `world_builder.status/2026-08-25` exists because they were being added
/// together. Under the superseded contract `pose_count` was
/// `keyframes - poses_refused`, and the Tower's build counts a segment ANCHOR
/// as neither solved nor refused — so every anchor was promoted to a camera
/// position. On the 2026-08-24 walk that produced *"Camera poses: 36"* from a
/// build whose manifest read `poses_solved: 0, points: 0`: nothing had been
/// reconstructed, and 36 was the segment count.
///
/// An anchor is definitional, not measured — identity rotation, zero
/// translation — so the two are now separate figures and this type keeps them
/// separate. `posesAnchor` is reported *beside* `poseCount`, never folded into
/// it, which is what lets an uncalibrated walk read as "36 segment origins, no
