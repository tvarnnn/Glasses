/// The world-visualization container: the place a spatial model will eventually
/// be drawn, and today the place the app explains that there is not one.
///
/// It renders `WorldModelState` and nothing else, so it cannot show geometry
/// the Tower did not send. Every state is now reachable:
/// `TowerWorldBuilderClient` maps the Tower's `model_state` onto them.
///
/// Deliberately absent, and each for a reason:
///
/// - **No 3D framework.** SceneKit, RealityKit and Metal are still absent, and
///   now for a sharper reason than "nothing to render". There *is* something to
///   render — points and poses arrive over HTTP, per segment — but the
///   manifest's `up_axis` is `"unknown"`, so a 3D view would have to guess
///   which way is up, and segments are unregistered, so a single scene would
///   superimpose reconstructions that share no coordinate frame. A top-down
///   `(x, z)` `Canvas` per fragment is both cheaper and the only honest
///   projection available. See `WorldFragmentsView`.
/// - **No single world map.** Each fragment gets its own frame, its own scale
///   and its own box until the Tower registers them. Per-segment scale
///   disagrees by up to ~87x on a real walk; one shared scale would draw
///   something that looks like a room and means nothing.
/// - **No animated placeholder.** A drifting point cloud would look like
///   progress and be a fabrication.
/// - **No spinner in the unsupported state.** A spinner claims work is
///   underway; nothing is underway.
///
/// ## Availability outranks state
///
/// The `availability` parameter is consulted *before* the domain state. If the
/// Tower cannot serve this cartridge — no contract, a contract this build does
/// not implement, or an unreachable Tower — then no `WorldModelState` is worth
/// drawing, and the shared `CartridgeStatePanel` says which of those three it
/// is. That ordering lives in one place (`CartridgeAvailability.forcedPhase`)
/// so all four cartridges obey it identically.

    /// **This is not a performance fix, and it should not be read as one.** This
    /// view sits under `WorldBuilderWorkspaceView`, which observes
    /// `GlassesConnection` because it draws the viewfinder, so that body runs at
    /// the 24 Hz capture rate during a session — and it evaluates this argument
    /// on every one of those. The composition moved up a level; it did not
    /// disappear. Two small string allocations per body, against frame encoding
    /// happening in the same window, is not obviously worth caching, but it is
    /// worth *measuring* on the Mac rather than assuming either way.
