/// The World Builder workspace: what the glasses see, and what the Tower builds
/// from it.
///
/// ## What this screen may and may not claim
///
/// Those two halves are still in different states, and the whole design of this
/// view follows from saying so plainly.
///
/// **The capture half is real.** The iPhone can start the glasses camera, and
/// frames genuinely reach the Tower — that is the V0.7 pipeline, measured and
/// working.
///
/// **The world half is now reported rather than absent.** The Tower declares a
/// World Builder contract over the socket and reports what it has built, and
/// `TowerWorldBuilderClient` decodes it. What this screen shows is therefore
/// whatever the Tower says, and nothing else.
///
/// **Starting capture is still not the same as starting a build.** The Tower's
/// web process writes frames to a capture and answers `frame_result`; the
/// reconstruction runs in a *separate* process reading that capture from disk.
/// Whether one is running is not visible from the phone, and this app must not
/// imply it started one.
///
/// Three consequences, each of which is a deliberate refusal:
///
/// - **No "Start Mapping" button.** A verb-labelled primary button is the
///   strongest readiness claim a UI can make, and tapping it does not start a
///   build. The control says what it does — it starts a capture session — and
///   the world panel reports what the Tower says came of it.
/// - **No placeholder metrics.** A field the Tower did not report is not drawn
///   at all, rather than drawn as "—": six redacted values read as *broken*
///   rather than as *absent*.
/// - **No fabricated geometry.** No mesh, no spinner outside the two states
///   where work genuinely is underway, and no single world map. The Tower now
///   does send points and poses — over HTTP, per segment, never down the
///   socket that carries the frames — and this screen draws exactly those,
///   each segment in its own frame because the Tower has not registered them
///   into a shared one. What it will not do is composite them into a room
///   nobody measured.
///
/// The live preview presents `GlassesConnection.latestCapturedFrame` through
/// the same `ViewfinderCard` the Home workspace uses. It does not open a second
/// camera session; there is exactly one stream and one owner.
