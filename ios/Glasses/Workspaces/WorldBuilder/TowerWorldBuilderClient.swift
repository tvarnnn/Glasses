// MARK: - Payload decoding

/// Turns the Tower's `world_builder.status` payload into the types the

///
/// ## Why the mapping is this thin
///
/// Because the Tower does it. `model_state` names a `WorldModelState` case and
/// `world_snapshot` is shaped onto `WorldSnapshot` field for field — deliberately,
/// so that the translation table lives on the machine where changing it is a
/// restart rather than an App Store release.
///
/// ## The blocks that are read, and why only those
///
/// Everything else in the payload is Tower-native evidence for those two
/// values, and a reader looking for where `lifecycle`, `progress`, `world`,
/// `tracking`, `calibration`, `persistence` or `artifacts` are consumed will
/// correctly find that they are not. Three exceptions, each for something the
/// projection cannot carry:
///
/// - **`trajectory`**, for `poses_anchor` and `segments`. The projection keeps
///   `pose_count` and drops both, and those are exactly what separates a walk
///   that positioned 36 cameras from one that produced 36 segment origins and
///   positioned none.
/// - **`session`**, for `capture_id`, `ended_at` and `frame_source`. Not a
///   figure and never drawn as one — it answers *whose world this is*, which
///   `world_snapshot` cannot, and which `WorldSessionGate` needs.
/// - **`session.session_id` and `geometry.revision`**, read by
///   `geometryCoordinates(from:)` for **addressing rather than display**. The
///   geometry itself is fetched over HTTP and those are what address it.
///   Neither is rendered.
///
/// ## What it refuses to do
///
/// Absent stays absent. Every optional here is `nil` when the key is missing or
/// null, and nothing is defaulted to zero — the contract is explicit that
/// `null ≠ 0`, and `frames_observed` being genuinely unknowable during a live
/// session is the reason it says so.

///     ↓ stateUpdates, geometryUpdates
/// WorldBuilderViewModel     republishes into SwiftUI, and fetches geometry
///                           over HTTP from the address it was handed

/// **outlives every workspace switch** — which is the whole reason that
/// container exists. A partly-built world survives closing the cartridge, and
/// nothing here is torn down by SwiftUI.
///
/// ## What it does not own
///
/// No socket. It holds a reference to the one `TowerClient` the app already
/// has and sends three message types over it; it never opens a connection,
/// never reconnects, and never touches the frame path. `GlassesConnection` is
/// not reachable from here at all.
///
/// **And no geometry.** It publishes the *address* of the geometry the Tower
/// reports and fetches none of it. The points travel over HTTP, from the view
/// model, because the Tower gives its result sender and its frame path one
/// shared lock and a megabyte of points down this socket would starve the
/// frames.
///
/// ## Reconnect
///
/// There is no delta stream, so there is no gap, so a reconnect cannot lose
/// data: subscribe again and the first message is a complete snapshot.
/// `subscriptionID` restarts at `sub-1` on every socket, so it is cleared
/// whenever the connection leaves `.online` and re-earned on the way back.
///
/// The last known state is **not** cleared on a drop. Availability already
/// resolves to `.towerUnreachable` while the socket is down, and
/// `CartridgeAvailability.forcedPhase` makes that outrank any domain state — so
/// the screen says "disconnected" without this client having to fabricate a
/// world that stopped existing. When the socket returns, the next snapshot
