/// Cached segment geometry, keyed by `(content_hash, placement_hash)`.
///
/// Keyed by hash rather than by segment index on purpose: a re-solved segment
/// keeps its index and changes its contents, so an index key would serve stale
/// geometry under a fresh revision. A hash key cannot.
///
/// ## Why the key is a pair, and what keying on content alone cost
///
/// Because the Tower freezes a segment when tracking is lost, a closed
/// segment's **geometry** never changes again — so its points and poses cross
/// the wire once and are kept for the life of the world, and only the open
/// segment churns.
///
/// **Its geometry. Not its identity, and not where it sits.** Registration is a
/// layer *above* frozen segments: geometry immutable, placements mutable. A
/// later pass places a segment an earlier one could not, and loop closure moves
/// placements rather than points — so `content_hash`, which covers poses and
/// points only, deliberately does **not** move when a segment gains a
/// placement. That is what keeps every cached chunk valid across a registration
/// pass, and it is safe only because `placement_hash` moves instead.
///
/// Keyed on `content_hash` alone this cache therefore never refetches a
/// re-placed segment. It keeps the chunk it has and the client draws an
/// **unplaced** version of a segment the world now knows how to place. Nothing
/// throws, nothing logs, no tile goes blank: the fragment simply sits in the
/// wrong place, permanently. `geometry_revision` rolls up both hashes so the
/// change signal does fire — the entire risk was in this dictionary.
///
/// The key is built by `WorldGeometryCacheKey` and nowhere else, so the two
/// halves cannot drift apart at a call site.
