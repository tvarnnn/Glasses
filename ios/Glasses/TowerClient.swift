/// One `frame_result` message, as the Tower actually sends it today.
///
/// Not a guess at a future protocol — every field here is one the Tower
/// builds in `tower/tower/routes/ws.py:148-165`, and every one is optional (or
/// empty-by-default) because the decoder must not fabricate a value the
/// message omitted.
///
/// ## The earlier version of this comment was wrong, and it cost a cartridge
///
/// It read: *"The Tower's whole per-frame vocabulary is `seq`,
/// `mean_intensity` and `processing_ms` — it runs one fixed handler and has no
/// module runtime."* Both halves were false. `ws.py` sends **five keys
/// unconditionally** — `seq`, `processing_ms`, `result_value`, `result_label`
/// and `stage_ms` — and adds `mean_intensity` and `metrics` when the
/// experiment produced them. The Tower does have a module runtime:
/// `tower/tower/main.py` builds a `ModuleContainer` around a live
/// `ExperimentalCVModule`, and a running Tower reports `module_state: active`
/// on `/health`.
///
/// So `result_value` and `result_label` — the experiment's own answer, the
/// only thing the Tower says about what it *concluded* rather than how long it
/// took — were arriving on every single frame and being dropped on the floor,
/// while the Experimental CV Lab workspace told the wearer the Tower "cannot
/// run experiments yet".
///
/// The Tower's registry used to say the same thing from its side:
/// `experimental_cv` was `not_offered` on the result channel because *"results
/// already reach the client on `frame_result`"*. **That has changed.** A Tower
/// speaking `experimental_cv.status/2026-08-27` offers the cartridge, and every
/// `frame_result` now carries a `cv_lab` block naming the run, the experiment
/// and the provenance that produced the numbers beside it — see `cvLab` below.
/// Everything that was on this message before is still there, unchanged, in the
/// same place.

///
/// Before it, the Tower's per-frame reply named the *number* and not the
/// experiment: `result_value` with `result_label` beside it, and no way to tell
/// which of eight experiments produced them, on which run, measured or
/// inferred. A result from a previous experiment could be read as a result from
/// the current one, and the Experimental CV Lab workspace said so on screen
/// because it was true.

///
/// > **Discard any `frame_result` whose `cv_lab.run_id` is not the run you are
/// > watching.**
///
/// The Tower makes this structural rather than checked: a new experiment is a
/// new run, and the old experiment is released **before** the new run id is
/// published, so no result computed by one experiment can carry another's name.
/// The client-side rule exists for the case the Tower cannot cover — a
/// reconnect to a **restarted** Tower, which starts counting runs again from 1.
/// `runID` is `"<tower_instance_id>-<n>"` and `towerInstanceID` is part of it
/// for exactly that reason, which is why comparing `runID` alone is sufficient
/// and no separate instance check is needed.

/// know which run is being watched.

/// ## Refusal, not failure

/// Tower is explicit that these are counted under `frames_rejected` and **not**
/// under `frame_processing_errors` — *"a Lab paused for five minutes has not
/// failed hundreds of times"* — and this client owes the same discipline:
/// nothing here touches `status`, the send window, the stream bracket or
/// `SenderMetrics`' error counters. It decodes, publishes, and returns.
