///
/// ## Which of these are the wire's own bytes, and which are assembled
///
/// `stopped` is verbatim: `GET /scene` on a Tower whose Scene session had been
/// started and then stopped. Every constant, every limitation slug, every
/// refusal reason and the whole `side_convention` sentence are the Tower's.
///
/// `running` is **assembled** from that same payload plus the scene block
/// `tower/results/scene_understanding.py` produces — `counts` over
/// `REPORTED_CLASSES`, `_side_counts`, `_people_block`. It has to be: `torch`
/// is not installed on this host, so `POST /scene/start` reaches `failed` with
/// *"the engine could not be loaded: ModuleNotFoundError: No module named
/// 'torch'"* and no live payload with counts in it exists here. The shape is
/// taken from the Tower's own builder rather than invented, and the field is
/// flagged here so nobody later mistakes it for something that was observed.
///
/// The `failed` fixture's `failure_reason` **is** real: it is the sentence this
/// host produced.
