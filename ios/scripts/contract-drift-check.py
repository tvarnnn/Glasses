"""Compare the contract identifiers this iOS build implements against the
identifiers a live Tower actually serves.

Why this exists
---------------
Every contract fixture in `GlassesTests` was captured by hand, off a Tower
that was running at the time. Nothing re-checks them. If a Windows lane
publishes `world_builder.status/2026-09-01`, this build keeps passing 388
green tests against the old bytes and only finds out on a device, in a room,
with the glasses on.

This script is the check that was missing. It reads the identifiers out of
the Swift source (so it cannot drift from the source the way a second list
would) and asks a live Tower what it serves.

Exit codes: 0 agreement, 1 drift, 2 Tower unreachable.
